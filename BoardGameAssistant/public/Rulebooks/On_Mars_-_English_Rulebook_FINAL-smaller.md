# MARS

Following the success of robotic rover missions, the United
Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars
Exploration (DOME). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year
2037. In the decades after the Mars Base Camp was established,
private exploration companies started working towards the
creation of a self-sustaining colony.

As a chief astronaut from one of these enterprises, you want
to be a pioneer in developing the biggest, most advanced colony
on Mars by achieving both DOME mission goals as well as your
company's private agenda.

In the beginning, you are very dependent on supplies from
Earth, and have to travel a lot between the Mars Space Station
and the surface of the planet. As the colony expands over time,
you will construct mines, power generators, water extractors,
greenhouses, oxygen condensers, and shelters. The aim is to
become a self-sufficient colony, independent of any terrestrial
organization. This will require carefully balancing the importance
of water, air, power, and food - the things we need to survive.

Do you dare take part in humankind's biggest challenge?

## GAME OVERVIEW

The game is played over several rounds, each
consisting of two phases: The COLONIZATION
PHASE and the SHUTTLE PHASE.

During the COLONIZATION PHASE, each player
takes a turn, during which they take actions.
The actions a player is able to take depends
on the side of the board they are on. If players
are on the Space Station in orbit, they can take
blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and
take supplies from the warehouse. If players are
at the colony on the surface of the planet, they
can construct buildings with their bots, upgrade
these buildings using blueprints, hire scientists
and take new contracts, welcome new ships, and
explore the planet's surface with their rover.

In the SHUTTLE PHASE, players may travel
between the colony and the space station in orbit.

All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each
other and some are required for the colony to
grow. Building shelters for colonists to live in
requires oxygen, generating oxygen requires
plants, growing plants requires water, extracting
water from ice requires power, generating power
requires mining minerals, and mining minerals
requires colonists.

Upgrading the colony's ability to provide each
of these resources is vital. As the colony grows,
more shelters are needed so that the colonists
can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.

During the game, players are trying to complete
missions. Once a total of three missions have
been completed, the game ends.

To win the game, players must contribute the
most to the development of the first colony on
Mars. This is represented during the game by
players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The
player with the most OP at the end of the game
is declared the winner.
