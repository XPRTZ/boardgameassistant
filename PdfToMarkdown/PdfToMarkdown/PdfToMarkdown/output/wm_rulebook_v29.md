# A VITAL LACERDA GAME

FOR 2 TO 4 PLAYERS


# RULEBOOK

"Natural disasters will soon be a thing of the past!" proclaimed Professor Sêni
Lativ, Project Chief of Meteorological Manipulation at Lightning Technologies.
Tests of his new invention, the Weather Machine, showed positive results. Visions
of quelling floods, subduing cyclones, and ending droughts made him smile.

In Weather Machine, you are scientists on Prof. Lativ's team, tampering with
control of local weather: adjusting rainfall for farms, maintaining wind and clear
skies for ecological energy sources, and tweaking the temperature for resorts or
sporting events. The prototype is quite effective so far; however, a pattern has
emerged, revealing a worrying side effect: Each use of the Weather Machine also
alters the conditions elsewhere on the planet - a "butterfly effect."

Prof. Lativ's dreams of eliminating climatic catastrophes quickly evolve
into nightmares of ending humankind. Each test causes worse side
effects. One day, the professor bursts into the lab with resolve in his eye,
followed immediately by stone-faced stoics in suits.

Government officials have accepted the urgent nature of the situation, as well as
the fact that only Prof. Lativ's team might fix the very problem he has stirred up.
"We must build a new prototype," he announces as the agents shoot him sidelong
glances; " ... but this time we're going to get it right." The agents silently give a
single, crisp nod of confirmation. "The government is funding this, and we will
succeed."

As Prof. Lativ explains the plan, the need to secure suppliers for sufficient bots
and chemicals is clear. In addition to the materials, time is of the essence; you
must be focused and efficient to have any hope of reining in his growing global
terror, Earth's atmosphere, before conditions are too harsh for Homo Sapiens and
countless other species of all biomes.

At this point, Professor Sêni Lativ will be remembered as a mad, but
brilliant, scientist for as long as humanity survives, but you could go
down in history as the savior of the world.

In Weather Machine, you take on the role of one of the Scientists working with Professor Lativ. You must manage your own Laboratory, acquiring Vouchers to spend
in other Locations, building Bots, acquiring Chemicals, and increasing the size of your Workshop where you will store resources and build prototypes. Once you have
conducted enough research into a particular type of weather, you want to publish a paper on the subject, and then build a prototype to help fix some of the extreme weather
caused by experiments made by Lativ's flawed Weather Machine. The research into those flaws will lead to breakthroughs that will help humanity to fix extreme weather
forever, getting you Awards and possibly a Nobel Prize!

#### LOCATION 3 - LATIV'S LAB

15\. Separate the Experiment tiles by Stage (I, II, III)
and shuffle each Stage separately, keeping the
tiles face-down. From the Stage III tiles, choose
3 at random and return them to the box unseen.
Then create a single face-down deck by placing
the Stage I tiles first, the Stage II tiles on top,
and lastly the remaining 2 Stage III tiles on top.
Finally, flip the entire deck face up and place it
on the indicated space.

16\. Place the top 3 tiles of the Experiment deck in
the 3 spaces to the right of the deck (the display).
Then place the next tile from the Experiment
deck in the space below the deck.

17\. Place the Assistant below the Machine branch
indicated by the weather on the tile on top of the
Experiment deck. In the setup image, the top tile
on the Experiment deck depicts Wind, therefore
the Assistant is placed in the Wind branch.

18\. Place Lativ's 5 Bots to the side of the Lab.
2-Player Game: Place 1 of Lativ's Bots on the
bottom space of each branch of the Machine.

# PLAYER'S LABORATORY

Each player sets up their own Laboratory as follows:

a. Your Assembly Line is divided into 4 sections, each with 3 spaces. Place your 12 Bots on these spaces.

b. Place your Voucher markers on the starting positions of each of your Voucher tracks as follows:

4 Supply, 1 Government, 1 Lab, 1 R&D, and 2 Science.

c. Place your Breakthrough markers on their spaces to the right side of your Office.

d. Take 1 Machine Part of each color and give one at random to each player, returning any leftovers back to the
reserve. Place your Machine Part on the space in the middle row of your Workshop.

e. Take 1 Workshop tile from the top of the face-down stack per player and give one at random to each player.
Place your tile next to the middle row of your Workshop, oriented so that the colored half-circles are at the
top and bottom.

f. Take a random set of 9 Goal tiles (ones with the same symbol in the bottom left corner) and place them face
up below your Laboratory.

Note: Page 23 contains a variant rule for expert Goal drafting which replaces step f.

# VOUCHERS

Scientists spend and receive Vouchers from Lightning Technologies to access other locations and be able to continue their
crucial work.

Your Voucher markers track how many Vouchers you
currently have of each type. Vouchers are gained by
moving your Scientist to a Location and also spent at
other Locations to perform actions.

Whenever you gain a Voucher, move the corresponding
marker up. Whenever you pay a Voucher, move the
marker down.

You can only gain a Voucher if you have space for it.
If you do not, gain only what you can.


<figure>
</figure>


You can never pay what you do not
have. However, Science Vouchers may be
spent as if they were any other type of
Voucher.


# YOUR WORKSHOP

Scientists must increase the size of their Workshop as they require more and more space for holding chemicals, bots,
and to build bigger branches of their prototype machines.


<figure>

6

</figure>


At the start of the game, your Workshop consists of
the 3 spaces on the right side of your Laboratory and
your first Workshop tile. This will increase in size as
you add new Workshop tiles to it.

Your Workshop is where you store your Bots,
Chemicals, and Machine Parts. Whenever you gain
one of these, you must immediately store it in your
Workshop. If you do not have space for something,
you cannot gain it.

You also build your prototypes in your Workshop
with your Machine Parts.

The space in the top left of your Workshop can hold
1 Chemical of any type. Other Chemicals are stored
on a matching colored space formed by two adjacent
Workshop tiles (one per space).

The space in the middle left of your Workshop can
hold 1 Machine Part of any type. Other Machine
Parts are stored on Workshop tiles (one per space).

The space in the bottom left of your Workshop can
hold 1 Bot. Other Bots are stored on Workshop tiles
(one per space).

Note: A Workshop tile can only store 1 Machine
Part OR 1 Bot.

Bots, Chemicals, and Machine Parts may be moved
around your Workshop at any time (including
swapping the positions of two items), as long as each
one is moved to a legal space.

Workshop tiles cannot be moved or rotated after
placement.

Note: You may not remove a Bot, Chemical, or
Machine Part from your Workshop unless you
are explicitly allowed to do so. I.e., if you gain a
Chemical and have no space for it, you cannot
remove another Chemical from your Workshop to
make space.

Whenever you pay a Machine Part, return it to the
reserve. Chemicals are either returned to the Supply
or placed in R&D when spent (as indicated by the
action). Bots are never spent, but instead moved to
spaces on the board as determined by your chosen
action.


# Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Orange moves to R&D and gains 3 Government
Vouchers (1 for the Location and 2 for the Scientists to
his left). He only has space for 1, so he just gains 1.


# Example:


<figure>

C

A

B

</figure>


1 Machine Part can be stored in [Â).

1 Bot can be stored in [B].
Either 1 Machine Part or 1 Bot can be stored in (C).


# Example:


<figure>

A

9

</figure>


Any 1 Chemical can be stored in Â, and a Radieu (blue)
can be stored on the space formed by 2 Workshop tiles 1B).

# GAME STRUCTURE

After an initial Supply round (see next page), the game is played over a series of
rounds, with each round divided into 3 Phases.

PHASE A: Player Turns. In turn order, each player takes a turn.

PHASE B: Run Weather Machine experiment.

PHASE C: End of Round. Adjust turn order. Possible income.

This continues until the end of the game is triggered (see page 22). After final
scoring, the player with the most CP is the winner.

# EXECUTIVE EXCHANGES

To help the Scientists work efficiently, Lightning Technologies allows them to exchange vouchers to speed up their research by granting them some advantages.

You can perform the following Executive Exchanges during the game:


## SCIENCE EXCHANGE


<figure>
</figure>


?
Whenever you need to pay
a Voucher, and you do not
have one of the required type
(or a Science Voucher), you may pay any 3 other
Vouchers instead to gain 1 Science Voucher which
you then pay as the required Voucher.
:


## Example:


<figure>

E
P

</figure>


Orange needs to pay 1 Government Voucher but
does not have any. Instead, he could pay 1 Science
Voucher, but he does not have any of those either. So
he pays 2 Lab Vouchers and 1 R&D Voucher to get a
Science Voucher and be able to pay.


### CHEMICALS EXCHANGE


<figure>
</figure>


?
Whenever you need to pay a
Chemical, and you do not have
one of the required type, you
may pay any 2 Vouchers to exchange one of your
Chemicals with one of the required type from the
Supply. The returned Chemical is placed on the
rightmost matching empty slot of the Supply. Then,
take the leftmost Chemical of the required type
from the Supply, and immediately use it for the
originally intended action (you do not need space in
your Workshop for this Chemical).
:


#### Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Yellow needs to pay a Melgoth (white) but does not
have one. She pays 2 Vouchers to exchange a Verdino
(green) that she has for a Melgoth which is immediately
used to complete the action.


##### MACHINE PARTS EXCHANGE


<figure>
</figure>


Whenever you need to pay a
Machine Part, and you do not
?
1
:
have one of the required type,
you may pay any 2 Vouchers to exchange one of
your Machine Parts with another Machine Part
from the reserve.


###### Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Black needs to pay a green Machine Part but she
doesn't have one. She spends 2 Vouchers to exchange
a red one she has for a green one.

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


# POST-SETUP SUPPLY ROUND

After setup is complete, but before the game begins,
in turn order, each player takes a turn during which
they perform any number of the actions in the Supply
Location (paying the cost as usual). These actions are
described on page 13.


<figure>

?

</figure>


After all players have performed
their actions, if any player
performed the Take the Initiative
action, the turn order is adjusted
at the end of the Post-Setup
Supply Round (see page 13).


# ? PHASE A: PLAYER TURNS

In this Phase, each player in turn order
takes a turn. On your turn, perform the following
steps in order:

1\. Use 1 Subsidy tile OR 1 Investment tile.

2\. Move your Scientist.

3\. Perform actions.

4\. Place Research tokens.


<figure>
</figure>


Also, at any time during
your turn, if you have any
Award tokens on the space
to the top-left of your
Office, you may place
them on any empty spaces
of your Office, gaining
the benefit depicted on
the spaces, if any.


# I. USE A SUBSIDY TILE


# OR INVESTMENT TILE m

Start your day with the advantage of a Government subsidy or an investment in your work.

If you have any Subsidy tiles that are blue-side up to
the left of your Laboratory, you may flip one of them
over to gain the benefit printed on it. These benefits
are all described on page 8 of the Player Aid.

Note: Subsidy tiles are single-use only; once
flipped, they cannot be flipped back over.

You never pay Vouchers when using a Subsidy tile,
even if the tile allows you to perform an action that
would normally cost you Vouchers.


<figure>
</figure>


Alternatively, if you have
any Investment tiles to the
left of your Laboratory, you
may return one of them to
the reserve to do one of the
following:

1\. Setting a Goal:

Move one of your Goal tiles
from below your Laboratory
onto an empty Goal space of
your Laboratory matching
the color of the tile. Gain the
benefit depicted on that space.


<figure>

43

H

3=

</figure>


On the top spaces choose
only 1 of the 2 depicted
benefits.

2\. Receive funding:
Flip one of the face up
Goal tiles already on
your Laboratory and
gain the benefits from
the corresponding
Funding track (see
page 10).

Note: Each Goal tile on one of your Goal spaces
is an objective that will be scored at the end of the
game if you meet the conditions depicted on the tile.

The reverse side of a Goal tile has a black
background. This indicates it has already been
flipped over, it is still scored at the end of the game.

Note: You can have more than 6 Subsidy /
Investment tiles next to your Laboratory. Just place
any excess nearby.

To start his game, Purple decided to pay his Vouchers
getting 2 Bots (the first Bot he takes costs him 1 Supply
Voucher but he gains 1 Lab Voucher, the second Bot
costs 2 Supply Vouchers but gains him 1 Science Voucher
(that he may expend immediately if he wants). He
also pays 1 Supply Voucher for 1 Workshop tile, and
1 Science Voucher for 1 Chemical. Finally, he pays 1
Science Voucher to take the Initiative.


# Example:


<figure>

These tiles can be used

</figure>


Yellow has 3 Subsidy tiles (2 blue-side up and 1
orange-side up), and 1 Investment tile. At the start of
her turn, she can choose to flip one of the blue Subsidy
tiles over to gain the benefit of the tile. Alternatively, she
could return an Investment tile to set a Goal or receive
funding.

# FUNDING TRACKS

For each Location, the work done by you and your Bots increases your recognition, thereby gaining more external sponsorship and funding for your research.
The more you do, the more funding you get.

Whenever you receive funding (by flipping
over one of your Goal tiles), you gain the
benefits of the track corresponding to the
color of the tile flipped (blue = Government,
green = Lab, purple = R&D).

The position of your Funding marker on each
track will determine how many CP you get at
the end of the game from that track.

### 2. MOVE YOUR SCIENTIST

Scientists need to move around every location to be able to do their work. To support this, Lightning Technologies
provides vouchers to give them access to the different locations.


<figure>
</figure>


Choose any empty action space
in a different Location from
your current one and place
your Scientist on the space.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In Round 1, all
players must move to the middle space of
a Location if the Location is empty. If the
middle space is occupied, the rightmost
space may be chosen instead. The leftmost
action space cannot be selected in Round 1.

After placing your Scientist, you gain/pay Vouchers
depending on the Location chosen:

. For the Main Locations (2,3,4), you gain the
Voucher depicted on the space where you place
your Scientist, plus an additional 1 Voucher of the
same type for each other player to the left of your
space. You also gain 1 Science Voucher if Lativ is
at that Location and also to your left.

. In the Supply Location (1), you first gain a
Voucher of any type (including Science) and, if
Lativ is there, you also gain 1 Science Voucher.
Then, you must pay 1 Voucher of any type for
each other player on spaces to the left of your
space. If you cannot pay the Vouchers, you cannot
place your Scientist in this Location.

Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Black moves her Scientist to Supply. She gains 1
Voucher of any type first, plus 1 Science Voucher for
Lativ being there. However, she must then pay any
2 Vouchers because there are 2 other players at the
Location, and to her left.


#### Example:


<figure>

\-

</figure>


Purple moves his Scientist to the Government Location.
He gains 1 Lab Voucher first, and an additional 1 Lab
Voucher for the Yellow player to their left. He also gains
1 Science Voucher because Lativ is at the Location (and
to their left).


## MOVING LATIV

Lativ is the chief Scientist of the company and the
inventor of the Weather Machine. His role is to make
sure his team has all that they need to ensure their
research runs as smoothly as possible.

After gaining / paying Vouchers, if Lativ is at the
Location you moved to, move him to the next
Location in numeric order. For Locations 1 & 5, place
Lativ on his designated space. For Locations 2-4, Lativ
moves to the leftmost empty action space. If all action
spaces are full, Lativ moves to the next Location.


<figure>

5

5

</figure>


If Lativ moves, check
the active branch of the
Weather Machine in the
Lab (the one where the
Assistant is).

If Lativ does not have one
of his Bots in that branch,
place 1 of Lativ's Bots
from the area next to the
Lab onto any empty space
of the branch (it doesn't
matter which one).

If Lativ already has a
Bot in the branch, or the
branch was full, place a
Bot in the next branch
(following the arrows). If
all the branches are either full or already contain one
of Lativ's Bots, nothing happens.


## Example: Moving Lativ


<figure>
</figure>


Orange moves his Scientist to the Lab (where Lativ is),
causing Lativ to move to R&D. Since Orange moved to
the left of Lativ he does not get the Science Voucher.


<figure>

X

73

</figure>


Lativ tries to place a Bot in the active branch of the
Weather Machine (Wind). However, the active branch
is already full, so the next branch is checked (Sun).


<figure>

TA

X

</figure>


The Sun branch already contains one of Lativ's Bots, so
the next branch is checked (Fog) and Lativ places a Bot
there.

In a 2-player game, if Lativ moves to Government
or R&D, discard a Research token from Lativ's
current Location of the same type of weather as the
branch where Lativ's Assistant currently is.

### 3. PERFORM ACTIONS

Time to improve this great invention and save the world.

The symbol on the action space where your Scientist
is determines how many actions you can perform.

Action spaces in the Main Locations (2-4) depict one
of the following symbols:

You may perform 1 of the actions.

&
You may perform 1 or both of the actions.

The Supply Location is explained at the bottom of
this page.

All actions are optional; it is allowed to perform no
actions at a Location.

Full details on each Location action are provided below.

### 4. PLACE RESEARCH TOKENS

Close your day's work recording your research.


<figure>
</figure>


At the end of your turn, if you
have any Research tokens on
the space to the top left of your
Office, you must now place
them onto empty spaces in your
Office that match the color of
the token. After placing a token,
gain the benefit depicted on the
space you just covered, if any.

Remember, you may place any Award tokens at any
point during your turn (including now), or save them
to place on a future turn.

Note: Each row can
only have Research
tokens of one type
of weather. However
you are allowed to
start more than one
row with Research
tokens of the same
type of weather.


<figure>

X

</figure>


If you are unable to legally place a Research token,
remove it from the game.

Note: Any Research tokens gained during the
running of the Weather Machine must be placed
immediately (see page 20).


# Example:


<figure>

4

</figure>


During Purple's turn, he gained a Snow Research token
and an Award token. At the end of his turn, he must
place the Research token on a matching color space. He
can choose to keep the Award token for play at any time
on one of his future turns.

He places the Research token on the space indicated by
the arrow to gain the benefit of the space (advancing his
marker 1 space on the Government Funding track).


<figure>

X

</figure>


He would have preferred to gain 2 Supply Vouchers by
placing the token on the bottom row, but he already has
a Rain Research token in that row and cannot have both
Snow and Rain Research in the same row.


# LOCATION ACTIONS

All of the actions available at the Locations in the game are described in this section. Remember that to take an action, you must have first moved your Scientist to an action space in
the Location and spent/gained Vouchers as described on page 11. Many of the actions require you to pay Vouchers, move a Bot, pay a Machine Part, use a Chemical, etc. For all of
these actions, if you do not have the required items (or perform an Executive Exchange to get them), you cannot perform the action.


<figure>

76

75

74

</figure>


# LOCATION 1: SUPPLY

Bots, Chemicals, and Workshop extensions are all needed tools and resources to allow you to keep researching
and improving the Weather Machine.

In this Location, all action spaces depict the
symbol. Therefore, any player at this Location may perform any
number of the actions listed on the next page, and each of the actions may be taken multiple times.

<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>
</figure>


# EXTEND WORKSHOP

Pay 1 Supply Voucher to take
any face-up Workshop tile from
the offer (the 4 tiles on the
board, or the tile from the top of the face-up stack).
Place that tile next to your Laboratory (see below).

Immediately after taking one of the tiles from the
board, place the top tile from the face-up stack to
refill the offer.

As soon as the face-up stack is empty, flip over the
face-down stack so there is a new face-up stack.


## PLACING WORKSHOP TILES

Each Workshop tile you gain must be placed
immediately, extending the size of your Workshop.
Workshops can extend as far to the right as you like,
but may not extend above or below the edge of your
Laboratory (3 rows high).

Each tile must be placed orthogonally adjacent to
an existing part of your Workshop (the pre-printed
spaces on the right side of your Laboratory and any
other Workshop tiles previously placed). You can
choose one of two orientations when placing the tile
(with the semicircles at the top and bottom), but the
colors on touching semicircles must match.

Once placed, Workshop tiles cannot be moved or
rotated during the game.


## Example:


<figure>

Purple takes the Workshop tile shown here.

(Â¡ He cannot place it here as the semicircles do not match.

[B] He cannot place it in either of these places because it
would be outside the bounds of his Laboratory.

C) He can place it in any of these places.


<figure>
</figure>


## CONSTRUCT A BOT

?
Choose one of the Bots from your
Assembly Line, pay the cost in
Supply Vouchers depicted at the
top of the section the Bot is in, and then move that
Bot to an available space in your Workshop.


<figure>

O

</figure>


When you remove a Bot from your Assembly Line,
immediately gain the benefit depicted next to the slot.


<figure>

8

</figure>


Note: At the start
of the game, you
may only choose

from the top two sections. The bottom two sections
are only available once you have constructed the
depicted number of Bots (6 or 9), or you have
the depicted number of Research/Award/Citation
tokens in your Office (5 or 8).
Any tokens on the space to the top left of your
Office also count towards this.

Note: During Income in Phase C you will also gain
the benefit of empty spaces in the top 2 sections.

Bots must be placed in your Workshop (see page 7).
If there is no space, you cannot perform this action.


<figure>
</figure>


# TAKE THE INITIATIVE

Pay 1 Supply Voucher to move
your Initiative marker into a
new position, sliding all other
markers to the left or right, as appropriate. During
Phase C, the order of the Initiative markers will
determine the turn order for the following round.


<figure>
</figure>


## Example:

Purple chooses this action and moves his Initiative
marker from the last to the first position.

# ACQUIRE A CHEMICAL

Choose a type of Chemical and take the
leftmost Chemical of that type from
the Supply, paying a number of Supply
Vouchers as indicated by the section it is
in. Place the Chemical in your Workshop.

Chemicals can be placed in your Workshop on any
empty space matching the color of the Chemical
(see page 7). The space you start with can hold 1
Chemical of any type. If there is no available space,
you cannot perform this action.


<figure>

# Example:

If this is your Workshop,
you have 3 spaces to store
Chemicals.

IÂ¡ Any one Chemical.
[B] Only a Radieu (blue)
Chemical.

IÇI Only a Verdino (green)
Chemical.


# RETURN A CHEMICAL

Choose a Chemical from your Workshop,
place it on the rightmost empty matching
space of the Supply. Then, gain the
indicated Supply Vouchers for the section
it was placed in.


## Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Purple returns a Delugium (pink) Chemical back to the
Supply; it is placed in the '2 Vouchers' section and he
gains 2 Supply Vouchers.

If a Radieu (blue) Chemical was returned instead, only
1 Supply Voucher would be gained.

# LOCATION 2: GOVERNMENT

Realizing the huge advantages of the Weather Machine, the government wants a piece of the pie. So, in exchange
for the company building new prototypes for them, they are willing to offer subsidies and share their research data.

There are two possible actions in this Location. Each action may only be performed once per turn.

To perform this action, follow these steps in order:

1\. Advance your marker 1 space on the Government
Funding track.

2\. Place 1 Bot from your Workshop onto an empty
Bot space of the Government Machine. You must
have a Machine Part in your Workshop matching
the color of the space where you place the Bot.

3\. Take 1 of the Subsidy tiles (can be either side
up) from the same column as the Bot you just
placed and place it blue-side up to the left of your
Laboratory.

Replace the Subsidy tile you took with a Machine
Part from your Workshop. The color of the
Machine Part must match the color of the space
where you placed your Bot.

Note: You must take a Subsidy tile that does not
match one you already have, if able. If you are
unable to do this (you already have a Subsidy tile of
each type in the column), take any 1 tile from the
column and discard it.

4\. Take a Research token from below the column
where you placed the Bot (if available), placing it
on the space to the top left of your Office. If there
are no Research tokens remaining in the column,
take an Investment tile from the reserve and place
it next to your Laboratory.

After these 4 steps are complete, check to see if the
Government runs their Machine (see next page).


<figure>
</figure>


Then, he moves a blue Machine Part from his Workshop
onto the space where the Subsidy tile was taken from.


<figure>

## GOVERNMENT RUNS THEIR MACHINE

The government are also building their own machine
to help fix the extreme weather caused by Lativ's
experiments.

If, after performing the Sell a Part action, all Bot
spaces in that branch of the Government Machine
are full, the Government activates that branch. To do
so, follow these steps:

1\. Each player gains 3 CP for each of their Bots in
the just completed branch.

2\. Move 1 Government marker from the
Government area to the leftmost empty space
on the Extreme Weather tile that matches the
branch. If all the spaces on the Extreme Weather
tile are now full, the weather is fixed: Return
the tile to the top of the corresponding stack
next to the board (discarding any Breakthrough
markers on it to the box, and returning
any Government markers on it back to the
Government area).


<figure>
</figure>


## SECURE SUBSIDY Cost: 2 Government Vouchers


<figure>

?

?

</figure>


To perform this action, follow these steps in order:

1\. Choose a blue-side up Subsidy tile from the
Government area and gain the benefit depicted at
the top of the column and to the left of the row
that the tile is in.

2\. Gain the benefit of the tile chosen and then
flip it over. See page 8 of the Player Aid for an
explanation of the Subsidy tiles.

Note: You never pay Vouchers when using a Subsidy
tile, even if the tile allows you to perform an action
that would normally cost you Vouchers.


### Example:


<figure>
</figure>


The Wind branch of the Government Machine is
complete. Each Bot in that branch gains 3 CP, so here,
Orange gets 6 CP and Purple gets 3 CP.


<figure>

·88

</figure>


A Government marker is then moved onto the Wind
Extreme Weather tile. Since it is now full, the Purple
marker is discarded, the Government marker is returned,
and the tile is placed back on the stack next to the board.


<figure>
</figure>


### Example:

Yellow chooses the indicated Subsidy tile.

She gains 1 Science Voucher as shown at the top of the
column, and 1 R&D Voucher as shown to the left of the
row.

Finally, she publishes a paper (as depicted on the tile),
and then flips the tile over.

# LOCATION 3: LATIV'S LAB

Lativ's Lab is where the original Weather Machine was built. It is where all the experiments are run, and the
place where all the data about the glitches is gathered to improve the machine. The Lab is where you publish
your research and where you can increase your reputation in the eyes of the government.

There are two possible actions in this location. Each action may only be performed once per turn.

track.

2\. Move 1 Bot from your Workshop to an empty
space in any branch of the Weather Machine (one
of the 5 columns).

Alternatively, you can move one of your Bots to
a space already containing one of Lativ's Bots. If
you do this, move Lativ's Bot to another empty
space of the same branch. If there is no other
empty space, return it to the side of the Lab.

Note: Having more Bots in a branch gains you
more CP when the experiment runs (see page 20).

3\. Pay 1 Chemical of the type depicted on the space
(moving it from your Workshop to the rightmost
empty space of the Supply matching the type of
Chemical).

Note: At the end of every round, if the branch
with the Assistant has Bots in every space, the
experiment may run (see page 20).

To perform this action, choose a completed row in
your Office which has a Breakthrough marker next to
the tokens and at least one of the tokens is a Research
token (a completed row is one with 3 tokens in it).


<figure>
</figure>


Note: If you only have two tokens in
a row, you may cite a previous piece of
work at this time to complete the row
immediately before publishing (see below).


<figure>
</figure>


# CITATIONS

Immediately before publishing, if
you have 2 tokens in a row of your
Office and the Lock token from the
corresponding Citation space has been removed,
you can cite the previous work to complete your
row (even if that work was your own).

To do so, choose a Goal tile from below your
Laboratory whose color matches the space in
your Office you want to place a token. Remove
that Goal tile from the game (put it back in the
box), take a Citation token from the reserve
and place it on the chosen space in your Office,
gaining the benefit depicted on the space, if any.

Note: The 2 tokens you have in the row in
which you place a Citation token could be either
2 Research tokens, or 1 Research token and 1
Award token.

Then follow these steps in order:

1\. Slide the Breakthrough marker to the rightmost
space of the row, gaining the benefit that you
moved the marker over.

2\. Score CP for the published paper: 2 CP
for each Research token in the row and
4 CP for each Award token in the row.
Citation tokens are not worth any CP.


<figure>
</figure>


3\. Take an Investment tile from the reserve and place
it to the left of your Laboratory.


<figure>
</figure>


Note: If the Citation space
1
:
matching the weather of the
published paper still has a
Lock token on it, remove that
Lock token from the game. If you do, you may
immediately pay 1 Science Voucher to gain 3 CP.

the Sun by any player, the Lock token is removed from
the Sun Citation space. He chooses to pay 1 Science
Voucher to gain 3 CP.

# LOCATION 4: RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

This Location is where you help to make a better world by finding a way to fix the extreme weather conditions.
R&D is where you collate the results of the Lab experiments and send your Bots to build an improved
prototype. As a Scientist, it is also the place where you show the world your work and get recognition for it. You may be
driven by the Awards and even dream of a Nobel Prize.

There are two possible actions in this Location. Each action may only be performed once per turn.

2\. Move 1 of your available Bots from your
Workshop to an empty Research space in any
branch of R&D.

3\. Pay 1 Chemical of the type depicted to the left of
the space, moving it from your Laboratory to the
left of where you placed your Bot (not back to the
Supply).

Note: If placing on the bottom space of a branch,
also pay any 1 Chemical or any 1 Machine Part
(as depicted to the right of the space). A Chemical
spent in this way is returned to the rightmost
empty space of the Supply matching the type of
Chemical.

4\. Gain the benefits depicted on the space where you
just placed your Bot.

Note: If you placed a Bot on the bottom space, you
gain another Bot from your Assembly Line (in the
same way as described in the Supply Location, but
without paying any Supply Vouchers).

5\. Take a Research token from below the column (if
not available see next paragraph), placing it on the
space to the top left of your Office.


## COMPLETING A BRANCH IN RED

If you place the last Bot in a branch, take an
Investment tile instead of a Research token.


<figure>

Also, if that type of weather still has
a Lock token on the Citation space
(no player has published a paper for
this type of weather), remove the Lock
token from the game and you may immediately pay
1 Science Voucher to gain 3 CP. From this point
onwards, players can cite that type of weather.

what makes you think another prototype will fix it now?

3\. Build the prototype, granting CP to you and
possibly other players (see below).


<figure>
</figure>


4\. Take an Award token from the
reserve, and place it on the space to
the top-left of your Office. If this
was your 3rd Award token, also take
the Nobel Prize if still available (this
is one of the end of game triggers).

After performing this action, if all the spaces on


<figure>
</figure>


the Extreme Weather
tile are now full, return
the tile to the top of the
corresponding stack next
to the board. Discard any
Breakthrough markers on it
to the box, and return any
Government markers on it
back to the Government
area.


# BUILDING A PROTOTYPE

As part of the Breakthrough action, you must build a prototype with Machine Parts in your Workshop.

You must provide the Machine Parts depicted on
the Extreme Weather tile, if any. Then, for each
Research space in the branch:

. If there is no bot on the space, you must provide
the Machine Part depicted on the space.

. If there is one of your bots on the space, you
gain 2 CP for your bot, and you may also
provide the depicted Machine Part or not.

. If there is another player's bot on the space, you
may provide the depicted Machine Part. If you
do not, the owner of the bot gains 2 CP.


<figure>
</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


## Example:

Purple builds a Wind
prototype.

This needs 1 magenta
(from the tile) and 1 green
Machine Part (from the
empty space). For the
space where he has a Bot,
he may choose to provide
the part himself, or let his
Bot provide it. For the
space where the Yellow
player has a Bot, he may
choose to provide the part
himself, or let Yellow's
Bot provide it (and let
Yellow gain 2 CP).


### You gain 2 CP for each Machine Part provided.

All Machine Parts you provide must be in the same
row of your Workshop. Return all Machine Parts
provided to the reserve, along with any additional
Machine Parts in the same row of your Workshop
(you do not get CP for any additional parts
returned in this way).

Remember: You can rearrange Machine Parts
and Bots in your Workshop at any time.


## Example:


<figure>
<figcaption>Purple builds a prototype using 1 magenta, 1</figcaption>

X

</figure>


<figure>
<figcaption>blue, and 2 green Machine Parts. Those parts
must all be in the same row of his Workshop.</figcaption>

V

</figure>


# Example:


<figure>
</figure>


Purple builds a prototype using 1 magenta and 2 green
Machine Parts. Even though it was not required for the
prototype, the extra white Machine Part would also be
returned to the reserve because it is in the same row.

However, Purple decides to first rearrange his Workshop
and swap the positions of the white Machine Part with
one of his Bots. Now, he can build the prototype and not
lose any more parts than the ones required.


# Example:


<figure>

4\.

</figure>


To build the Sun prototype to fix the Level 3 Extreme
Weather, Orange has 4 options:

1\. Provide 2 pink and 1 green Machine Part. Orange
gains 8 CP (6 CP for 3 parts, plus 2 CP for his Bot).
Yellow gains 2 CP.

2\. Provide 2 pink, 1 green, and 1 white Machine Part.
Orange gains 10 CP (8 CP for 4 parts, plus 2 CP
for his Bot). Yellow gains 0 CP.

3\. Provide 3 pink and 1 green Machine Part. Orange
gains 10 CP (8 CP for 4 parts, plus 2 CP for his
Bot). Yellow gains 2 CP.

4\. Provide 3 pink, 1 green, and 1 white Machine Part.
Orange gains 12 CP (10 CP for 5 parts, plus 2 CP for
his Bot). Yellow gains 0 CP.

# PHASE B: RUN WEATHER MACHINE EXPERIMENT

Time to run the Weather Machine and get some recognition for our work with Lativ. These experiments are crucial to get the data we need to improve the Weather
Machine. Worsening the weather is just collateral effect. A small price to pay for the greater good.

In this Phase, Lativ's Assistant attempts to run the Weather Machine in the Lab. The active branch is the one where the Assistant is.

The active branch
is Wind.

There is a Wind
Experiment tile in
the display and there
are Bots on each
space of this branch,
so the experiment
runs.


## Example: Experiment doesn't run


<figure>

</figure>


The active branch
is Fog.

Even though there
is a Fog experiment
tile in the display,
not all of the spaces
in that branch are
full of Bots, so the
experiment does not
run. Yellow may take
back her Bot.

The first thing to do in this Phase is to check if the
experiment runs or not.

The experiment runs if both of the following
conditions are met:

. There is at least one Experiment tile in the display
matching the weather of the active branch.

. There is a Bot on every space in the active branch.

If only one, or none of the conditions are met, the
experiment does not run.


## IF THE EXPERIMENT RUNS ...

The Experiment tile in the display matching
the weather of the active branch is known as
the active Experiment tile. If there is more
than one matching tile, the rightmost tile is
the active one.
&

In turn order, each player with a Bot in the active
branch performs the following steps in order:


<figure>
</figure>


1\. Return your Bots from the active branch to
your Workshop. If you do not have space
for a Bot, return it to any empty space in
the top two sections of your Assembly Line.

2\. You may pay the number of Science
Vouchers as depicted on the active
Experiment tile. If you do, continue with
steps 3-5. If you do not, skip steps 3-5.

Remember: If you do not have a Science Voucher,
you may pay any 3 Vouchers of
other types to gain 1 Science
?
Voucher at this time.
:


<figure>
</figure>


?

3\. Gain CP as depicted on the Experiment
tile for each Bot you just returned.

?

4\. Gain one of the two benefits depicted on
the tile (no matter how many Bots you
had in the branch).

Note: If you are unable to receive the full benefit
(e.g., you only have room for 1 Machine Part when
the benefit is to gain 2 Machine Parts), you may
take as much of the benefit as you can.


<figure>
</figure>


5\. Take a Research token from below the active
branch (if available), immediately placing
it in your Office. If you do not have a
legal space for the token, remove it from
the game. If there are no Research tokens
remaining, gain 1 Science Voucher instead.

2-player game: See page 23 for a special rule.

Once all players have performed the steps, the
experiment is completed. Return any of Lativ's Bots
on the active branch to the side of the Lab.


<figure>
</figure>


Then, take the top Extreme
Weather tile from the
stack matching the type
of weather and place it on the
corresponding space in R&D,
covering any tile already there.
Any Breakthrough markers on the
existing tile are returned to the box,
and any Government markers are
returned to the Government area.

# IF THE EXPERIMENT DOES NOT RUN ...

All players with Bots in the active branch may choose
to return them to their Workshop. If you do not have
space for a Bot, return it to any empty space in the
top two sections of your Assembly Line.

Return any of Lativ's Bots on the active branch to
the side of the Lab.


<figure>

</figure>


# PREPARING FOR THE NEXT EXPERIMENT

At the end of this Phase, whether the experiment
runs or not, perform the following steps:

1\. Remove from the game the rightmost Experiment
tile in the display matching the weather of the
active branch (if any). Slide any other tiles in the
display to the right to refill any gaps, then place
the tile below the deck to the leftmost space in the
display, and finally, place the top tile of the deck
on the space below the deck, if able.

2\. Move Lativ's Assistant to the next branch. If
already in the Snow branch, move them to the
Rain branch.

The active branch is Rain. There are two
current Experiment tiles depicting Rain,
so the rightmost tile is the active one. Yellow is earlier
in turn order and returns her Bot to her Workshop. She
chooses to pay 2 Science Vouchers, gaining 6 CP for her
1 Bot. She then chooses to perform the Research action.
Finally, she takes the last Research token from the
branch, and places it in one of the rows in her Office.

Purple is next. He returns his 2 Bots to his Workshop,
but only has 1 Science Voucher, so he pays his 1 Science
Voucher and then uses an Executive Exchange to use 3
other Vouchers as the second Science Voucher. He gains
12 CP for his 2 Bots, and chooses to take an Investment
tile. Finally, because there are no Research tokens
remaining in the branch, he gains 1 Science Voucher
instead.

Here, the experiment does not run because the active
branch (Sun) is not full.

Yellow and Black choose to leave their Bots on the
branch, hoping it will be useful later in the game.

The Sun Experiment tile is discarded and new tiles are
moved along to fill the gaps.

The Assistant moves to the next branch (Fog).

# PHASE C: END OF ROUND

Preparing for tomorrow is an important task of the day.

During this Phase, the turn order is adjusted, and if Lativ is in his Office, players gain income.


## ADJUSTING TURN ORDER

Adjust the Turn Order markers to match the order of
the Initiative markers.

# END OF GAME

Last chance to prove your value.

The end of the game is triggered once any of the
following happens:

· A player takes the Nobel Prize.

. The last Experiment tile is placed in the display
during Phase B.

. The Government Machine is completed
(all Bot spaces are occupied).

. All Research spaces in R&D are occupied.

Finish the current Round, and then play 1 last round,
skipping Phase C in the final Round.


## Example:


<figure>

880

4

</figure>


During Phase B of this round, an experiment ran,
causing the last Experiment tile to enter the display at
the end of the Phase. This triggers the end of the game.
Play Phase C. The next round is the final round.

During Phase B of the Final Round, starting with
the branch where the Assistant is, and proceeding in
order of the arrows, check each completed branch of
the Weather Machine. For each branch, if there is a
current Experiment tile matching the type of weather,
run the experiment following the usual rules. Then,
proceed to final scoring.


<figure>
</figure>


Wind and Sun run before final scoring because both branches
are filled with Bots, and the Experiment tiles are in the display.


# FINAL SCORING

Of course you are the best scientist.

Just before final scoring, all players, in turn order,
may place any Research tokens and/or Award tokens
they have next to their Laboratory onto empty spaces
of their Office, following the usual rules.


<figure>

98

99

</figure>


This is done to help them meet the conditions
of their Goal tiles. Players may also use their
Investment tiles to place or flip a Goal tile.


<figure>

</figure>


Each player then scores for the following:


<figure>

?

</figure>


. CP according to the
position of their marker
on each Funding track.
Score the highest value
CP above or to the left of
your marker.

. 5 CP for each Goal tile
on one of their Goal
spaces that they meet the
conditions for (see Player
Aid).

. 5 CP if a player has the
Nobel Prize.


## Example:


<figure>
</figure>


On the R&D track Black and Orange score 3 CP,
Yellow scores 4 CP, and Purple scores 6 CP.


## Example:


<figure>

B

</figure>


Purple scores 10 CP for meeting the conditions of both
of his Goal tiles.


<figure>
</figure>


## The player with the most CP wins.

Tiebreakers are as follows:

· Number of Awards.

· Number of published papers.

. Number of completed rows in the Office.

. If there is still a tie, tied players share the place.

# DRAFTING VARIANT

Instead of each player getting a set of 9 Goal tiles at
the start of the game, divide the tiles by their symbol
(in the bottom left) and then subdivide them by
color. You should now have 12 sets, each consisting of
3 tiles of the same color.

· In turn order, each player chooses a set of 3 tiles
and places it below their Laboratory.

· Then, in reverse order, each player chooses a
second set of tiles, which must be a different color
from their first set.

. Finally, in turn order, each player chooses a third
set of tiles, which must be a different color to their
first set and second set.

Each player should now have 9 Goal tiles, 3 in each
color.

# 2-PLAYER SUMMARY

Only 2 scientists are enough to save the world. With a
little help from Lativ.


## SETUP CHANGES

. Place one of Lativ's Bots in each branch of the
Weather Machine in the Lab.

. Use only 2 Research tokens of each type in each
Main Location.

. Place a Voucher marker of a non-player color on
the rightmost action space of each Main Location
(2,3,4). This action space cannot be used during
the game.


## GAMEPLAY CHANGES

. When Lativ moves to the Government or R&D,
discard a Research token from Lativ's current
Location of the same type of weather as the branch
where Lativ's Assistant currently is.

. When the experiment runs, after all players have
performed their steps, if there is one of Lativ's Bots
on the branch, remove from the game 1 Research
token from below the active branch, if able.


## 2-PLAYER VARIANT NEW SCIENTISTS

In addition to the 2-player rules above, Lativ
counts as another player for the purposes of gaining
Vouchers when placing a Scientist in a Location. This
is in addition to gaining a Science Voucher.


# DESIGNER TIPS

Saving the world is never easy.

. Take Subsidy tiles that give you extra actions early
in the game.

. Focus on only one or two types of weather at the .
beginning of the game for your Research.

. If you don't have the right Machine Part,
Chemical, or Voucher, remember the Executive
Exchanges.

· Think carefully when placing a Bot in the Lab.
They will only be useful if that branch runs an
experiment.

· Always make sure you are sending your Bots to an
experiment that you know will come out.

. Having more than one Bot in a branch of the
Government Machine or the Weather Machine will
earn you more CP.

. Try to Publish a Paper as soon as you can.

· When you build a prototype, if you use other
players' Bots, you will need fewer Machine Parts,
but gain fewer CP.

. Build a prototype as soon as you can; the Award
you gain will help you in your other research.

. Choose a couple of Goal tiles at the start of the
game and then work towards achieving them.

. Use your Investment tiles carefully. Setting a new
Goal can gain you CP at the end of the game, but
receiving the benefits from the Funding tracks can
also be very useful.


# EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS

Whenever you gain a benefit, you never pay Vouchers for it, even if it would normally cost Vouchers. You can find all the Subsidy tiles and Goal tiles in the Player Aid.
