VITAL LACERDA

KANBAN

A game for 1 to 4 players


# RULEBOOK

Kanban (the Japanese word for billboard) is the name for a scheduling system that supports
an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become more common since
2014. EVs are the future of the automobile industry. They are
superior vehicles due to being more efficient, easier to maintain,
cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines
that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will
provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades
during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their
traditional combustion engine counter parts, which start to
become obsolete as soon as you start using them.

Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie
employees, trying to secure their career. You need to manage
suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile
parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order
to boost production and impress the factory manager.

You must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the
limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when
the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run
at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you, or for
mistakes to be rectified.

Kanban is a game that focuses on resource and time
management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire
production facility, racing for factory goals and the highest level
of promotion. You will earn Production Points (PP) for performing
various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at
the end of the game is declared the winner.

Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and
keep the factory on tempo.

"So, you're what I've been sent to work with. Hmph. I am Sandra, the factory manager and you will be answering
to me for as long as you remain employed here. Due to your ... substandard ... education, I expect you to take
advantage of the company on-the-job training, so you can become competent with each department's
operations. I will be checking on your progress in a different department each day. You don't want to be the one
who hasn't done your homework - and you'd better not let your other responsibilities slip, either. Such infractions
will be registered in your permanent record. Think of it as a little incentive." - Sandra

# NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION

After setup, but before the game begins,
perform the following steps:

1\. Choose a start player at random.
Beginning with that player and in
clockwise order, each player places
their Certification marker on an
empty space in the 0 section of the
Certification track. When you place your
Certification marker on a space with
a depicted benefit, you immediately
receive that benefit.

Note: The order of the markers from right to left is im-
portant for the next step but is also turn order
for the first round of the game.

2\. In Certification track order (from right to
left), each player takes 1 Car Part from
Logistics and 1 Design tile from Design.

Any face-up Design can be taken,
including one from the top of one of
the stacks. Place each taken item in the
appropriate space on your Player board.

Note: During the game, taking a Design from the
rightmost 4 spaces gives you a benefit. That
does not apply to this step.

3\. After all players have taken a tile, refill
the empty Design spaces by sliding tiles
to the right in order to fill the gaps and
then filling any spaces that are still empty
with tiles from the corresponding stack
(top First Office stack for the top row;
bottom First Office stack for the bottom
row). Do not replenish the Car Parts.


# GAME STRUCTURE

The game is played over a series of rounds
with each round representing one day of
work in the factory. Each day comprises two
phases:

1\. Department Selection Phase: Players
take turns choosing a workstation in a
department in which they want to work.

2\. Work Phase: In department order,
players use their Shifts to work and/
or train in the department they chose.
After the end of the Work Phase, before
the End of the day, there may be a
Meeting.

This process continues until there has been a
certain number of Weeks and Meetings and
after final scoring, the player with the most PP
is declared the winner.


## 1. DEPARTMENT SELECTION PHASE

In the first day of the game, each player
in Certification track order (from right to
left) chooses an empty workstation in any
department and places their Worker meeple
on the space, standing upright. Sandra is
already at her desk in Administration.

In subsequent rounds, each player, in order
from top to bottom, selects a different
department to the one they are currently in
and then places their Worker meeple on an
empty workstation in that department. So
the choice you make in one day affects your
priority for choosing in the next day.


<figure>
</figure>


"Company cross-training policy disallows employees from working in the
same department for two consecutive work days." - Sandra

Important: In a 2-player game, players cannot move to a department where Sandra is.
This is true even for Administration.

Sandra also chooses a new workstation according to her own specific rules,
described on page 17.

</figure>


### 2. WORKING PHASE

In order of the Worker meeples from top
to bottom, each player takes a turn to
complete tasks. The number of Shifts you
have to complete tasks is determined by
the workstation you chose (2 or 3 in all
departments except for Administration, where
it is 1 or 2). Also, if you have any Banked Shifts,
you may spend some of those (by moving your
marker back on the Shift Bank track) in order
to work more; however you are never allowed
to work more than 4 Shifts in one day.

Most tasks can be completed in a single
Shift; however, a few take several Shifts to
complete.

Once you have completed
your Shifts, lay your Worker
meeple down at its
workstation to indicate that
your turn is over.


<figure>
</figure>


When it is Sandra's turn, she evaluates the
department she is in and completes her tasks
(see page 18). The exception to this is the first
day of the game where Sandra is at her desk,
dealing with paperwork.

After all players have worked their Shifts,
check to see if there is a Meeting or if it is
the end of the week, and then the next day
begins.


# EXAMPLE

Blue is working in the Design Department and has 2 Shifts to complete tasks. She also
has 3 Shifts banked, so she could spend up to 2 of those to work more. She chooses to
spend 1 Banked Shift and work 3 total Shifts that day.

# TRAINING AND CERTIFICATIONS

Before explaining how each individual
department works, there is something in
common to all of them.

Each department has its own training track
which indicates the current training level of
each player. When you work in a department,
one of the tasks you can do is to undergo
training in that department. For each Shift
you spend on this task, move your marker to
the next space, placing it on top of any other
markers already there.

Once you cross the arrow on a training track
of a department, you are considered to be
certified in that department. This usually
unlocks something on your Player board and
gives some benefit within the department itself
(described in the rules of each department).

Each time you become certified in a
department, perform the following steps:

1\. Discard the Lock from the corresponding
section of your Player board (see
Reference book).

2\. Choose an empty space in the next
section of the Certification track
to where your Certification marker
currently is, move your marker to it, and
gain the benefit of that space.

3\. Check to see if you have achieved a
Factory Goal (see page 16).


# EXAMPLE

Orange has just gained her first certification. Yellow got his first certification earlier in
the day, so one of the spaces in the next section has already been chosen. Orange
chooses the space depicting a Parts Voucher, places her Certification marker there
and gains 1 Parts Voucher.

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>

+1

</figure>


# HOMEWORK

When working in a department, you
can also train by reading books on
your own time, even if you didn't
spend any Shifts training.

On your turn, when working in a department,
before or after spending your Shifts, you
may return 1 or more Books to the supply to
move your marker one space forward on that
department's training track per Book used.
This does not cost any Shifts and it can be
done even if you have already spent all your
Shifts for the day.


<figure>
</figure>


## ADVANCED TRAINING

Even after you are certified in a
department, you may continue
to train until you reach the final
space on the track when you
are classed as an Expert in that
department. The first player
to become an Expert in each department
gains the Generic Speech token on top of the
Award stack.

Also, when you become an Expert, secretly
look through all of the remaining Award tiles in
that department, choose one and return the
rest face down back to the space where they
came from.

Award tiles give you an immediate benefit
and are then placed back in the box (see
Reference book for benefits).

All players reaching the final space can
choose one Award tile if there are still any
available.

At the end of the game, you will gain PP
based on your relative position on each
training track. Final scoring is explained on
page 21.


### EXAMPLE

Purple is working in the Design department and has a total of 3 Shifts to spend. He
decides to spend 2 Shifts completing the tasks of that department and then 1 Shift
training. He then also uses 1 Book to train once more.


<figure>

+1

</figure>


Purple returns to the supply 2 Books from his Player board
to train twice more.


<figure>

</figure>


Since he was the first to reach the Expert space, Purple
gains the Generic Speech token. Then he chooses 1
Award tile from those available, and receives its benefit.


# GOLDEN RULES


## GAINING BOOKS, PARTS VOUCHERS, AND BANKED SHIFTS

During the game, there are a number of
ways in which you can gain Books and Parts
Vouchers.

Whenever you gain either of these, place the
appropriate tiles to the side of your Player
board; you cannot use them on the turn that
you gained them. At the end of your turn,
move them onto your Player board.

There are also a number of ways of gaining
Banked Shifts. When you gain a Banked Shift,
move your marker up the Shift Bank. Like
Books and Parts Vouchers, these cannot be
used on the turn that you gain them.


<figure>

2

</figure>


Use your Banked Shift Reminder
token if you need to remember
how many Shifts you had at the
beginning of the turn.


<figure>
</figure>


## GENERIC SPEECH TOKENS

During the game, there are
a number of ways you can
gain a Generic Speech
token.

Each time you do, return the Generic Speech
token to the supply and move one of your
Speech tokens from the side of your Player
board onto an empty space of your Player
board. If all of the spaces are already filled,
place the Generic Speech token to the side of
your Player board instead (you will be able to
exchange them for your own Speech tokens
after each Meeting; see page 19).


<figure>
</figure>


Yellow gains a Generic Speech token. He returns the
Generic token, and places one speech token of his color
in an empty space of his Player board.

If Yellow didn't have any free spaces, he would keep the
Generic Speech token next to his Player board.

# DEPARTMENTS AND TASKS


<figure>
</figure>


## DESIGN DEPARTMENT

Designs are created here which can then be used in R&D to upgrade specific Parts and to move Cars into your garage for testing.


<figure>
</figure>


Orange is not allowed to take any designs from the 3 left-
most stacks. For that she needs to be certified and take
the Select an Advanced Design task.


<figure>
</figure>


Orange places the 3 designs in the proper places of
her Player board. Only one design can be held in each
space.

Other than training, there is only one
other task that can be completed in this
department: Select a Design.

This task moves a Design from the Design
department to your Player board. You will
need Designs to complete tasks in the
Research & Development department.


<figure>
</figure>


TASK: SELECT A DESIGN

To take a Design to your Player
board, spend 1 Shift and
perform the following steps:

1\. Choose one of the Designs on the
rightmost 8 spaces for each Shift you
spent. The Designs in the First Office and
Central stacks are not available with this
task.

2\. Move the chosen Design to one of the
available spaces of your desk on your
Player board, keeping it blueprint-side
up. If you do not have an empty space,
you cannot take the Design.

After you have finished spending your Shifts
here, slide all Designs in both rows to the right
to fill any gaps. Then, in each row, refill any
spaces still empty (from right to left) with tiles
from the First Office stack to the left of the
respective row for each empty space. If the
relevant First Office stack is depleted, refill
empty spaces with Designs from the Central
stack. If both are depleted, fill the top row first.

Note: You only refill Designs at the end of your turn,
after you have selected all the designs you
want to.


## WELL-RESEARCHED DESIGNS


<figure>
</figure>


If you take a Design
from one of the
rightmost four
spaces, you gain the
benefit shown between the two designs of
that column. This is either 1 Banked Shift, or 1
Book. If you take the four Designs from those
spaces you gain 2 Banked Shifts and 2 Books.
Remember that any benefits you gain cannot
be used in the same turn.

Example:

Orange spends 3 Shifts to take 3 Designs. She takes the ones shown in the second
image at left, and places them on her Player board. Then, the Designs in the Design
department are slid to the right to refill gaps and the empty spaces refilled.


<figure>

4

</figure>


At the end of her turn Orange slides all Designs to the right
and fills the empty spaces with new ones from the stacks.


<figure>
</figure>


### CERTIFICATION BENEFITS

Being certified in this department gives you
two benefits:

. You can store 1 additional Design on
your Player board.

. You may complete a new task:


<figure>
</figure>


### TASK: SELECT AN ADVANCED DESIGN

This task works the same way as the normal
'Select a Design' task, except you can
select the top Designs from the Central
stack and from the stacks in the First Office.
If you take the last Design from a stack in
the First Office, immediately replace it with
the one from the top of the Central stack.

<!-- PageHeader="LOGISTICS DEPARTMENT" -->

Stock the warehouses with a Kanban order, and collect the Car Parts you need.

Other than training, there are three other tasks
that can be completed in this department.
These tasks are related to acquiring Car Parts
which you will use in Assembly and in R&D.


<figure>
</figure>


### TASK: ISSUE KANBAN ORDER

To complete this task, spend 1
Shift and perform the following
steps in order:

1\. Gain 1 Banked Shift. Remember, any
Banked Shifts gained cannot be used in
the same turn.

2\. Choose a Kanban Order card from your
hand and place it on the Kanban space
vertically such that 4 of its symbols are
on one side of the line, and 2 are on the
other. You choose whether the top or
the bottom gets the 4 symbols. Kanban
cards can be rotated 180 degrees.

3\. For each symbol that matches a
warehouse on its side of the line, add 1
Car Part from the general supply to the
appropriate warehouse.

4\. Return the Kanban Order card face
down to the bottom of the deck.

5\. Draw the top card from the Kanban
Order deck into your hand.

Note: You can only complete this task once per turn.


<figure>
</figure>


#### TASK: COLLECT CAR PARTS

To complete this task, spend 1
Shift, take any number of Car
Parts from any one warehouse
and place them on storage spaces on your
Player board. You must have an available
space on your Player board for each Car Part
you take.


<figure>
</figure>


A Parts Voucher can be used
to acquire any one Part from
the supply that you need, but
only at the moment you need
it. It can be used only when
completing the tasks Provide
a Needed Part in Assembly
or Upgrade a Design in R&D,
as specified in the rules for
these tasks. You cannot return
a Parts Voucher and place
a Car Part from the supply
on your Player board. You
cannot use a Parts Voucher to
acquire a Car Part that is not
currently present in the supply.


<figure>

4

</figure>


The 2 Batteries, 1 Electronics, 1 Body and 1 Drivetrain
Parts on the card are on the same side of the line as their
matching warehouses and so those Parts are added to
their warehouses. The Autopilot System on the card is on
the other side of the line from the Autopilot warehouse,
and so is not added.


<figure>
</figure>


Blue spends 1 Shift to take all Batteries from the warehouse
and places them on her Player board.


<figure>
</figure>


CERTIFICATION
BENEFITS

Being certified in this department gives you
two benefits:

. You can store 1 additional Car Part on
your Player board.

. You may complete a new task:


<figure>
</figure>


### TASK: RECEIVE PARTS VOUCHER

To complete this task, you must be certified in
this department. Spend 1 Shift to take 1 Parts
Voucher from the supply and place it next to
your Player board. At the end of your turn,
move the Parts Voucher to your Player board.

Note: You can only complete this task once per
turn.


<figure>
</figure>


Blue spends 1 Shift, gains one Voucher and places it on
her Player board, She would like to take another one but
only one per player is available per turn.

## ASSEMBLY DEPARTMENT

Provide the Parts needed to complete the assembly of Cars and watch them roll down the line!


<figure>
</figure>


Before starting spending Shifts in the Assembly line, Purple
cleans the City Cars line because it's filled with Car Parts.


<figure>
</figure>


Purple cannot place the Body because one is already
in the City Car line. He can't place an Autopilot System
either, because he needs to provide the Upgraded Parts
first. In this case his only option would be Electronics.


<figure>

A

B

</figure>

By providing a unique Electronics to the Sports Car line,
Purple creates a chain of movements.


The Assembly line is made up of Assembly
spaces to hold the Car Parts and conveyors
that move the Cars down the line as they are
built. Eventually, they roll out to the Test track
in the R&D department.

FIRST: CLEAN OUT ASSEMBLY SPACES


<figure>

0

</figure>


At the start of your turn in
this department (or when
choosing to work here from
Administration), if a Model
has all of its Assembly spaces
full of Car Parts, return all of
those Car Parts to the supply.

Models which have Car Parts on only some
Assembly spaces are unaffected.

Other than training, there is only one
other task that can be completed in this
department.


### RECYCLING

At any time during your turn, you may
exchange a Car Part from your storage
with one in the Recycling pool. There can
only ever be 3 Car Parts in the Recycling
pool and each one must be different. The
use of Recycling is free and can be done
as many times as you want during your
turn. However, Recycling cannot be used
during Meetings.

Example:

Yellow spends 1 Shift
when working in the
Logistics department
to take 3 Body
Car Parts from a
warehouse. Thinking
ahead to his next
turn, he realizes he
will need a Drivetrain.
He doesn't have
one, but there is
one in Recycling. He
exchanges one of
his Body Car Parts
for the Drivetrain in
Recycling.


<figure>

Z

</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


TASK: PROVIDE
A NEEDED PART
To complete this task, spend
1 Shift and perform the
following steps in order:

1\. Move a Car Part from your Player board
to an empty Assembly space for any
Model.

. Instead of using a Car Part from your
Player board, you can spend a Parts
Voucher. If you do, take any Car Part
from the supply and place it on an
empty Assembly space.

. The Car Part must differ from any
others currently in the Model's
Assembly Spaces. Reminder: You can
use Recycling.

. If the Model has had any of its Car
Parts Upgraded (see R&D on page 14),
you must provide Upgraded Parts for
a Model first. You can only provide a
non-Upgraded Part once all Upgraded
Parts have been provided. The exact
order of Parts does not matter, only
that a Model must have all of the
Upgraded Parts added before any
non-Upgraded Parts.

2\. Move the Car at the top of this Model's
assembly line one position along the
arrows.

· When the position it is moving to is
occupied by another Car, that other
Car is displaced along the path
following the arrows to the next yellow
plate or off the conveyor.

. If there are multiple paths, you can
choose freely. This continues until no
further Cars are displaced.

. See next page if a Car moves off the
end of a conveyor.

3\. Place a new Car of this Model from the
supply at the beginning of this Model's
assembly line. Skip this step if there are
no more Cars of the Model in the supply.

Important: The Cars move on the Assembly line
each time one Part is added, not
just when all the Assembly spaces
are full.

<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>
</figure>


CAR MOVED OFF
THE END OF A
CONVEYOR

When a Car moves off
the end of a conveyor, it
rolls onto the Test track
in R&D. Perform the following steps:

· Gain 1 or 2 PP, depending on which
conveyor delivered the Car.

. If the Car Model matches the one
depicted on either of the Demand
tiles, take a Generic Speech token
from next to the Demand tile, if there
are any left.

. Move the Car to end of the line of Cars
behind the Pace Car on the Test track.

There can only be a maximum of 4 Cars
behind the Pace Car at any one time. If a 5th
Car were to enter the Test track, remove the
Car directly behind the Pace Car, advance
the other Cars to close the gaps behind it and
then place the new Car at the back. Return
the removed Car to the supply.


### FULFILLED DEMAND

At the end of your turn, if either of the
Demand tiles in this department have no
more Speech tokens next to them, the
current demand has been met. Set the empty
Demand tile to one side and draw a new
one from the stack of Demand tiles, placing
a number of Generic Speech tokens next to
it as indicated on the tile. After replacing
the empty Demand tile(s), shuffle the tiles set
aside back into the stack.


<figure>
<figcaption>Place 2 Generic Speech tokens at the side of the tile.</figcaption>

</figure>


### Example:

Purple spends 2 Shifts working in Assembly and uses both of them to provide needed
Parts. He first chooses to add a Part to the City Car (green Model), which currently has
no Upgraded components, so he is free to add whichever Car Part he wants with the
exception of the Body which has already been added. He chooses to add a Drivetrain,
moving the Car Part from his Player board to one of the empty Assembly spaces of the
City Car.

This moves the green Car along the conveyor, and he pushes the others as shown in
the image. To finish the task, another green Car is added to the start of the conveyor.

Second, he wants to add a Part to the Concept Car (black Model). Checking the
Upgraded components in R&D, the Battery and Autopilot System have already been
Upgraded. Therefore, both of these Parts must be added before adding any non-
Upgraded Parts. Unfortunately, he doesn't have either of these Parts himself, but there
is a Battery in Recycling. He exchanges his Drivetrain for the Battery in Recycling and
then uses that to assemble a Car.

The black Car is moved along the conveyor, pushing the others as shown. This causes
the green Car to roll off the conveyor and onto the Test track.


<figure>
</figure>


CERTIFICATION
BENEFITS

Being certified in Assembly unlocks the
5th garage space on your Player board.
Although this garage is unlocked by being
certified in Assembly, you only gain the
benefit of it when you park a Car in there
which is Part of the next department to be
explained ...


<figure>

</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


Purple provides a Drivetrain pushing all the City Cars down
the line. A new City Car enters in the beginning of line.


<figure>
</figure>


Purple needs a Battery or an Autopilot.
So he uses Recycling to exchange one of his Parts.


<figure>
</figure>


By placing the Battery in the Concept Car line, Purple
manages to move the City Car out of the line and scores
2 PP. The Car is ready to be tested.


<figure>

24

23

</figure>


Since City Cars were in Demand, Purple gains one Gener-
ic Speech token. Then he moves the Car to the Test track.

<!-- PageNumber="13" -->

<figure>
</figure>


## RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

Claim Cars from the Test track and park them in your garage for final testing, and/or upgrade Car Parts of the various models.


<figure>
<figcaption>Purple sends a City Car Design and a Truck Design to the
bottom of the Central deck, spends 3 Shifts and claims
both Cars.</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


Purple places each of the Cars in one of his garages,
gains the bonuses depicted, and then flips the Garage
tiles over.


<figure>
</figure>


Purple advances the Pace Car 2 spaces along the track.
It reaches (and passes) the striped space, so a Meeting
will take place at the end of the day.

Other than training, two other tasks can be
completed in this department. Claiming a
Car requires there to be a Car on the Test
track that matches one of your Designs, and
upgrading a Part requires you to have both a
suitable Design and a matching Car Part.


<figure>
</figure>


TASK: CLAIM CARS

To claim a Car, you must have
a Design on your desk that
matches a Car on the Test
track. To complete this task,
perform the following steps:

1\. Choose which Cars you want to claim
from the Test track. For each Car you
want to claim, return a matching Design
(one that depicts the Model of the
Car you want to take) from your Player
board to the bottom of the Central
stack. You must also have an empty
garage on your Player board for each
Car you want to take.

2\. Spend the appropriate number of Shifts to
take the Cars from behind the Pace Car.

. The 1st Car behind the Pace Car
requires 1 Shift.

· The 2nd Car: 2 Shifts

. The 3rd Car: 2 Shifts.

· The 4th Car: 3 Shifts.

3\. After you have finished claiming Cars,
advance the Pace Car a number of
spaces along the Test track equal to the
number of Cars you took. If the Pace
Car reaches or crosses a striped space,
move the Meeting marker to the proper
space in the Administration Department.
This indicates that there will be a board
Meeting at the end of the current day
(see page 19). Then advance the other
Cars to close the gaps behind it.

4\. Place each Car in any empty garage
on your Player board. For each Car you
place, receive the benefit depicted on
the Garage tile next to it (see Reference
book), and then flip the Garage tile.

5\. Check to see if you have achieved a
Factory Goal (see page 16).

Note: You only advance the Pace Car at the end of
your turn, after you have claimed all the Cars
you want to.

Note: To speed up the game, and because
choosing a garage may take some time, it is
recommended to keep your claimed Car(s)
next to your Player board until the end of your
turn. Only then proceed with the last steps.


<figure>
</figure>


### TASK: UPGRADE A DESIGN

To complete this task, you
must have a Design on your
Player board depicting both
the Model you wish to upgrade and the Part
you are upgrading, as well as the Car Part
itself.

Spend 1 Shift and perform the following steps:

1\. Move the Car Part you are using
from your Player board to any empty
Upgrade space for the Model you are
upgrading. Instead of using one of your
own Car Parts, you can spend a Parts
Voucher to take any Car Part from the
supply and place that on the Upgrade
space. Remember: You can also use
Recycling.

2\. Receive the benefit depicted in the
Upgrade space you filled (if any is
depicted).

3\. On the Upgrade Value track, move the
marker for the Car Part you used one
space to the right (if able). (The first
upgrade moves it into the first space.)

4\. Flip the Design you used face down to
show the Upgraded Design and place it
to the right of your Player board.

5\. Earn 2 PP (indicated on the Upgraded
Design side of the tile).

6\. Check to see if you have achieved a
Factory Goal (see page 16).

Note: Each Model of Car has one Design tile for
each Car Part, plus one Design tile which
does not feature a Part, and cannot be used
to upgrade.

<!-- PageNumber="14" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


## TESTED DESIGNS

Any Upgraded Designs you have, for which
you also have a matching Car in one or
more of your garages is considered to be
a Tested Design. When you have a Design
that is Tested (which could be immediately
after upgrading it, or immediately after
claiming a Car), move it from the side of
your Player board to above your Player
board, directly above a matching Car.

Tested Designs score you PP at the End of
each week (see page 19) and at the End of
the game (see page 21).

Note: If you have more than one matching Car,
it doesn't matter which the Upgraded
Design is above. The fact that the Design
is above your Player board indicates that
it is Tested. You can have more than one
Tested Design above each Car.


### Example:

Blue has 3 Upgraded Designs, one
from the SUV, one from a Sports Car
and another from a Concept Car. She
only has an SUV and a Sports Car in
her garages. Her SUV and Sports Car
Upgraded Designs are considered to
be Tested Designs.


<figure>
</figure>


Blue moves the SUV and the Sports Car above
the Cars garages. The Concept Car Design is not
Tested, so she keeps it next to her Player board.


<figure>
</figure>


## CERTIFICATION BENEFITS

Once you are certified in this department,
remove the Lock from your Double-Upgrade
tile on your Player board. You now have
a one-time ability to double-upgrade
a Design whenever you complete the
Upgrade a Design task.

When you do this, take the following steps:

1\. Increase the Car Part's value by 2
steps instead of just 1 (if able) and
flip its Value marker to the Double-
Upgrade side.

2\. Gain PP equal to the new value of the
Car Part.

3\. Flip your Double-Upgrade tile on your
Player board.

Note: Each type of Car Part can only be dou-
ble-Upgraded once during the game.
I.e. No two players can double-upgrade
the same Part.


## Example:

Blue is certified in R&D and is about to
complete the task: Upgrade a Design.
Since the value of the Car Part she
wants to use is already high, this is a
good time to do this.

The Design she wants to use is the
Drivetrain from her SUV. Blue doesn't
currently have a Drivetrain and there
isn't one in Recycling. However, she
does have a Parts Voucher, so she
returns this to the supply and places a
Drivetrain from the supply on an empty
Upgrade space of the SUV.

She flips the Double-Upgrade tile to
use the Double-Upgrade ability. The
value of the Drivetrain increases from
3 to 5 (two steps instead of one). She
flips the Value marker and scores 5 PP.
Then, she scores 2 PP for her Design
tile.

She places the Parts in the respective Models"
upgrade spaces, gaining 1 Book and 2 PP.

She then advances each of the related Value
markers one space to the right.

Blue scores 2 PP for each tile. Since only the Body is
Tested, she moves it to the top of the SUV garage

# ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT

From here, you can micromanage another department.

</figure>

Yellow also spends 2 Books to train in Administration and
1 more to train in Logistics.


When you work in Administration, you may
also choose one other department to work in.
You can split your Shifts and Books however
you like between Administration and the
chosen department: only in Administration, or
only in the chosen department, or in both.

Since there is no specific task in Administration,
Shifts worked here can only be used for
training.

Note: The Workstation spaces in Administration only
offer 1-2 Shifts, instead of the usual 2-3 Shifts;
however, this makes it a good place to use
those Shifts you've stored up in the Shift Bank.


## Example:

Yellow is at the Workstation that gives 2 Shifts, but he spends 2 Shifts from the
Shift Bank to work a total of 4 Shifts on this turn. He also has 3 Books. He chooses
Logistics as his other department and decides to spend 3 Shifts working in Logistics
and his remaining Shift to train in Administration. Then he spends 2 Books to train in
Administration and the 3rd Book to train in Logistics.


<figure>
</figure>


### CERTIFICATION BENEFITS

Becoming certified in Administration
allows you to have 1 additional
Speech token on your Player board.

Yellow gains his 3rd Certification and thus meets the
requirements of the Certification Factory Goal. He gets
one of the Speech tokens on the Goal.


## FACTORY GOALS

During setup, three pairs of Factory Goal
tiles were placed in the departments of the
factory where the board of directors want to
see some improvement:

· Claiming Cars for final testing in R&D

· Upgrading Designs in R&D

· Certifications

When a player meets the requirements of a
Goal, they immediately take 1 of the Generic
Speech tokens from its tile. Once all Speech
tokens have been removed from a Goal,
remove it from the board and place it back

in the box. It is possible for the same player to
achieve both Goals within a department.

THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOALS
ARE AS FOLLOWS:

· Claiming Cars: Have the indicated
number of Cars in your garages.

· Upgrading Designs: Have the indicated
number of Upgraded Designs.

. Certifications: Have the indicated
number of Certifications.

# SANDRA, THE FACTORY MANAGER

I'm responsible for the factory production and I'm here to evaluate your performance.


<figure>
</figure>


Like the other players, Sandra participates
in the Select Workstation and Work Phases,
following special rules:

In the first day of the game, Sandra is at her
desk in Administration doing paperwork; she
will perform no tasks that day. At the start
of each subsequent days, during the Select
Workstation Phase, Sandra takes her turn at
selecting a new department in the normal
order. Therefore, at the start of day 2, she will
be the last to move.

When she moves, she is placed on the next
empty Workstation of the next department
going from top to bottom. If all of the
Workstations in the next department are
full, she skips that department and moves
to the next one instead, and so on. When
moving to Administration, Sandra ignores
the Workstations and sits at her desk. On the
day after reaching her desk, she starts again
moving through the departments from top to
bottom.


## Example:

At the start of day 2, Worker meeples are lying down in Workstation Alley and Sandra
is at her desk. Each player in order selects a new Workstation to work in, and then
Sandra chooses last. Both of the Workstations in R&D are occupied, so she is placed on
the uppermost Workstation in Assembly.


## Example:

At the start of day 3, the players in R&D first choose a new department to work in,
followed by Sandra, and then the other players. If Orange and Purple both choose to
work in Logistics in day 3, Sandra will move to the empty Workstation in Design.


## EVALUATION

From day 2 onwards, when it is Sandra's turn
to act during Phase 2, she evaluates the
department she is currently in. She evaluates
the player or players who have the least
training in the department she is in.

If you are evaluated, check the criteria for
penalty on the table you can find on the next
page. If you meet this criteria, you lose 1 PP,
plus another 1 PP for each Banked Shift you
have fewer than 5.


## Example:

Sandra is evaluating the Design department. Purple, Blue, and Yellow are the equal
lowest on the training track and are all subject to evaluation. Blue has 4 Designs in her
desks and passes evaluation without penalty. Purple however only has 1 Design in his
desks and is penalized. He only has 2 Shifts banked and therefore loses a total of 4 PP
(1 + 5 - 2). Yellow has no Designs in his desks and is also penalized. However, he has
4 Banked Shifts, so loses 2 PP.


<figure>
</figure>


Both R&D Workstations are occupied. Sandra moves to
the next available Workstation from top to bottom.


<figure>
</figure>


Orange and Purple play first, and both move to Logis-
tics. Sandra plays next, and again moves to the next
available Workstation from top to bottom.


<figure>
</figure>


Purple, Blue, and Yellow are all tied on the lowest space
of the bottom track .

## END-OF-WEEK SCORING

When Sandra performs her Departmental Task
in Administration, the Week comes to an end
and all players score PP as follows:

· For each Car in your garage:

· Gain 1 PP for each upgrade that has
been made to that Model (by all
players). To do this, count the number of
Car Parts on the Upgrade spaces of the
Model.

have of that Model.

· Then, advance the
Week marker by 1
space unless it is
already on position
3 (in that case just
ignore this step).


### Example:

Orange has 3 City Cars and 1 Sports Car in her garages. The City Model has been
Upgraded 3 times, and she has 2 Tested Designs for the City Model. Therefore, each of
her City Cars is worth 5 PP; 15 PP in total.

The Sports Car has only been Upgraded once, and not by her, so it is only worth 1 PP.

### MEETINGS

Once we have enough test data, it's time for
everyone to meet in the Meeting room and
discuss our findings. This is time for you to show
off your accomplishments to Sandra.


<figure>
</figure>


As mentioned earlier,
when the Pace Car
reaches or passes a
striped space, move
the Meeting marker
3
I
to the Meeting space
in Administration. At
the end of that Work
phase, after everyone has taken their turns
(including Sandra), the Meeting begins.

Note: Recycling cannot be used during a Meeting.

At the Meeting, you will use your Speech tokens
to discuss Performance Goals and earn PP.

Remember, there are several ways you can
get Speech tokens:

1\. Being the first person to reach the last
space on a training track.

2\. Reaching the 2nd and 4th sections of
the Certification track.

3\. Accomplishing Factory Goals.

4\. Completing assembly of a Car that is
in Demand.

5\. Parking a Car in a garage that rewards
you with a Speech token.

At the start of the Meeting, there are 4
Performance Goals on the table. Each player
also has 3 in hand, of which 1 (and only 1)
must be played during the Meeting.

A Meeting is resolved with players taking
individual turns in Certification track order
(from right to left). Once all players have taken
a turn, the process starts again, following the
same order. If a player passes (see next page),
they can still take further turns in the Meeting,
but when all players pass consecutively, the
Meeting is over.

Example:

At the image in the right, players take turns during this Meeting in the following order:
Purple, Orange, Yellow, Blue, and then back to Purple, and so on.


<figure>
</figure>


Orange scores 3 + 2 PP from her City Car Upgrades. She
scores 15 PP because she has 3 City Cars (at 5 PP each).


<figure>
</figure>


She didn't upgrade any Parts on her Sports Car. She scores
the number of upgrades made by other players, for 1 PP.

In a later turn Blue plays one of her Performance Goals.
She decides not to place a speech token on it. From now
on she is allowed to Pass.

On your turn you must choose one of the
following two options:

A) Speak. Perform one or both of the following
steps:

1\. Play 1 of your Performance Goals from
your hand face up to the table near the
Meeting room.

Note: You must do this once and only once per
Meeting at some point before you pass.

2\. Place 1 of your Speech tokens on the
highest-numbered empty speech icon of a
Performance Goal of your choice that you
don't already have a Speech token on.

Note: If you played your Performance Goal this
turn, and if you choose to place a Speech
token, you must place it on that Goal.

3\. Score PP based on the Goal (see below).

OR

B) Pass. You can only pass if you have already
played one of your Performance Goals.
Remember, you can still take part in
the Meeting if you get a later turn in
the same Meeting.


#### Important notes on Performance Goals:

. You must play 1 of your Performance
Goals from your hand at each Meeting,
even if you will not score any PP for it.

· You are not required to play a Speech
token on your own played Performance
Goal.

. You may place a Speech token on a
Performance Goal, even if it will score
you 0 PP.


## SCORING PERFORMANCE GOALS

Sandra is very keen on the Performance Goals
but grows less interested in each one the more
she hears about it.

The number of Speech icons on a Goal
indicate the number of players who can
speak about that Goal at the Meeting. Each
Performance Goal depicts a number of PP at
the bottom, as well as a multiplier inside each
speech icon.

When you place a Speech token on a card,
you score the PP depicted for each time you
meet that Goal, up to a maximum number
of times as the multiplier shown on the icon
where you placed the Speech token.

Purple has 5 Designs, but he can only score 3. He places
a Speech token on the 3x icon and scores 6 PP (3 x 2 PP
per Design).


## Example 1:

Purple is excited to brag about the 5 Upgraded Designs he has, but the highest
multiplier is 3x, so Sandra only cares about 3 of them. He places a Speech token on
the card and scores 6 PP (3 Upgraded Designs, 2 PP each). Orange planned really
poorly for this Meeting, and this is the only Performance Goal worth anything to her.
She places a Speech token on the space with the 2 multiplier, but since she only has
1 Upgraded Design, she scores 2 PP (1 Design, 2 PP each). If she had 2 or more, she
would have scored 4 PP. This move annoys the Yellow player who has 3 Upgraded
Designs, but because Sandra is now getting tired of hearing about it, the only
space left is 1x. Despite having 3 Upgraded Designs, he can only score 1 of them. So
Yellow decides to score a different Goal. Blue has 1 Design, she wants to take the
opportunity, and places a Speech token on the card to score 2 PP.

## Example 2:

On a later turn, there are no Performance Goals left that interest Blue, so she plays
her own Performance Goal from her hand and places a Speech token on it. Purple
is focused on another Performance Goal that will give him good PP, and places a
Speech token on it. Orange is still irritated that they didn't plan well for this Meeting,
and is fed up with other players scoring so many PP. Seeing that Purple would be able
to score a lot of PP from the Performance Goal played by Blue, Orange places a
Speech token on that Performance Goal for 0 PP, in order to reduce the number of PP
Purple can score.

Since Blue can Pass her next turns, she will wait for new scoring opportunities from the
other players' Performance Goals.

## END OF THE MEETING

Once everyone passes consecutively, perform
the following steps:

1\. Return Speech tokens used during the
Meeting back to the respective players,
placing them to the side of their Player
boards. Unused Speech tokens (ones
remaining on your Player board) are not
moved.

2\. Each player with any Generic Speech
tokens by the side of their Player board
may return those tokens to the supply.
For each token they return, they move
one of their own Speech tokens from the
side of their Player board onto an empty
slot on their Player board.

3\. Discard all remaining face-up
Performance Goal cards.

4\. Determine the next Meeting's
Performance Goals:

a. Each player places 1 of their 2
remaining cards from their hand
face down on an empty space in the
Meeting room.

b. Reveal all the cards played.

c. If there are fewer than 4 players, fill the
rest of the spaces with cards from the
deck.

5\. Each player draws 2 new Performance
Goals from the deck and adds them to
their hand.

6\. Return the Meeting marker to the Test
track.

7\. Advance the Production Cycle marker
one space unless it is already in position 3.


## END OF THE GAME

The Production Cycle marker and Week
marker track the end of the game. When one
of them is at least on the 2nd space and the
other is at least on the 3rd, the end of the
game is triggered. Finish the day, including
a possible End-of-Week Scoring, Meeting, or
both, and then proceed to Final Scoring. (See
back page of this rulebook.)

Note: It is possible for there to be more than 3
Meetings before 2 Weeks have passed, and
vice-versa. The Meeting is always at the end
of the day.

## VARIANTS


### VARIANT 1 - NICE SANDRA

Sandra is in a much better mood. Instead of
punishing you for not being a good worker, she
rewards you for doing well!

During Setup, place your PP marker on position
0 of the track instead of position 15. Also, use
the other side of the Sandra Reference tile.

When Sandra evaluates a department, she
evaluates the player or players who have the
most training in that department instead of
the players with the least training.

If you are evaluated, check the table below.
If you meet the requirements listed, you gain
1 PP for each Banked Shift you have over 5.

E.g. If you have 7 Banked Shifts, you gain 2 PP.

### VARIANT 2 - THE PLANNER

Place your 4 Garage Bonus tiles in any order
that you want. The tile with the Lock on its
back is placed in the rightmost space. During
the game, however, when you Claim a Car, it
must be placed in your leftmost empty garage.


### VARIANT 3 - EXPERT TUNING


<figure>
</figure>


During setup, use the Expert
Garage tiles instead of the
Basic Garage tiles. Note that
you could have some players
using Basic Garage tiles and
others using Expert Garage
tiles (if experienced players are
playing with a new player).


### VARIANT 4 - DELAYED TUNING

In this variant, you keep the 4 leftmost Garage
Bonus tiles next to your board. Only the tile
with the Lock on its back is placed in the
rightmost space. When placing a Car in one of
your garages, you choose one of the tiles next
to your board, and place it in the space of
the garage of the Car you just took. You can
gain the bonus at any time on a future turn by
flipping the tile over. You cannot flip the tile in
the same turn you earned it. Since you cannot
use Books, Parts Vouchers, or Banked Shifts on
the turn you gain them, this means it will be
two turns before you are able to use them.
Because of this delay, Cars gained during the
last day of the game will not give you any
benefits.

Note: You are free to mix variants.

## 3-PLAYER RULES REMINDER

Make the following changes to the setup:

· Cover the Test track printed on the
Game board with the Test track overlay
showing the side with 3 people.

· Factory Goals: Place only 1 Generic
Speech token on the harder Goal of
each pair, for a total of 9 Speech tokens
on Factory Goals.

· Training Awards: Place only 2 Award tiles
on the last space of each department's
training track.

Make the following changes during the game:

· At the end of a Meeting, draw 1
Performance Goal from the deck to
make the 4th Performance Goal for the
next Meeting.


## 2-PLAYER RULES


<figure>
</figure>


### REMINDER

Make the following changes to the setup:

. Cover the Test track printed on the
Game board with the Test track overlay
showing the side with 2 people.

· Factory Goals: Place only 1 Generic
Speech token on each Factory Goal, for
a total of 6 Speech tokens on Factory
Goals.

· Training Awards: Place only 2 Award tiles
on the last space of each department's
training track.

Make the following changes during the game:

· At the end of a Meeting, draw 2
Performance Goals from the deck to
make the 3rd and 4th Performance
Goals for the next Meeting.

· Rule change: Players cannot move to a
department where Sandra is. However,
she can move to a department where
a player is. This is even true in the
Administration Department.

· Rule change: When Sandra is in the
Design department, she removes the 8
rightmost tiles instead of 4.


## RULES CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS EDITIONS

If you are already familiar with Kanban:
Automotive Revolution or Driver's Edition, here
are the changes to the rules in this edition:

. You may no longer replace Cars in your
garages with new ones.

· When Sandra penalizes you, you now
lose 1 PP in addition to PP for any
Banked Shifts that you have below 5.

. In the Nice Sandra variant, you are only
rewarded PP for Banked Shifts you have
over 5, instead of for all of your Banked
Shifts.

. There are 5 new Final Goal tiles to
choose from during Setup.


<figure>
</figure>


## SANDRA'S TIPS

. Keep an eye on Sandra's next move
and plan accordingly.

· Remember that if Sandra skips a
department, the game is one day
shorter. This movement may end the
game suddenly!

. Avoid penalties from evaluation. Try not
to be in the last position on the training
track and keep plenty of Banked Shifts if
you are.

. Sometimes it is OK to lose some PP to
keep your strategy.

· Watch what Designs your opponents
take; they may use them to claim a Car
that you want!

· Tested Designs are valuable. If you are
investing in Designs of a certain Model,
don't leave it to the last minute to
claim the Car you need to test those
upgrades.

· Don't be afraid of using the Workstations
with fewer Shifts. These allow you to
take your turn before a player on the
other Workstation.

. Use Banked Shifts to maximize your turn.

. In Logistics, try to take at least 1
Car Part that you may exchange at
Recycling; 1 type gives you access to
the other 3.

· Visiting Administration is the only way
to work in the same department on
consecutive turns.

· If you lose your `momentum', visiting
the Administration is the best way to
recover.

. Keep one eye on the Factory Goals.
Those extra Speech tokens are very
useful.

. Assemble Cars that are in Demand to
grant you Speech tokens.

. Remember the Performance Goals and
collect as many Speech tokens as you
can. You can score a lot of PP in the
Meetings.

· When you unlock a Certification benefit,
it can be used immediately.

. Keep an eye on the Production Cycle
and Week markers. The end of the game
may come sooner than you expect.

## FINAL SCORING

At the end of the game, each player performs
the following steps:

1\. Spend 1 Speech token per achievement
you wish to score on the Final Goal
tile. Each player may score each
achievement on the tile once (more
than one player can score the same
achievement). You may use Generic
Speech tokens. Final Goal tiles are
explained in the Reference book.


<figure>

52

</figure>


Orange achieved all Goals, but since she only has 2 Speech
tokens, she can score only 2 of them. Orange chooses to
score the 1st and the 2nd Goals, which scores her 15 PP.

2\. Earn 1 PP per Shift you have banked.

3\. Earn 1 PP per Speech token (either your
own color, or Generic), Book, and Parts
Voucher on your Player board.


<figure>
<figcaption>Blue gains 4 PP.</figcaption>
</figure>


4\. Gain PP for each of your Cars in your
garages. The PP gained per type is shown
under the Garages on your Player board.
The value of the Cars are as follows:
City Car 2 PP, SUV 3 PP, Truck 4 PP, Sports
Car 5 PP, Concept Car 6 PP.


### Example:

Purple has 2 City Cars, a Truck and 1
Sports Car in her garage. Purple scores
13 PP.


<figure>
<figcaption>Purple gains 4 PP for the City Cars, 4 PP for the Truck and 5
PP for the Sports Car.</figcaption>
</figure>


5\. Score for relative positions on each
department's training track:

· 1st: 5 PP

· 2nd: 3 PP

· 3rd: 1 PP


### Example:

In this situation, Orange scores 5 PP, Blue
scores 3 PP and nobody scores the 1 PP
for 3rd place.


<figure>
<figcaption>Yellow and Purple didn't train, so they gain 0 PP.</figcaption>

</figure>


Note: If more than one marker is on the same po-
sition, ties are broken in order of the markers
from top to bottom in the stack. So, ties go to
the player who had the most recent training.
A player who has not done any training in a
department cannot earn any PP for this step.

6\. For each of your Tested Designs,
gain PP equal to the value of the Car
Part depicted on it. The Part's value is
indicated above the Upgrade Value
track). Remember, a Tested Design is an
Upgraded Design for a Car you have in
your garages. These are the designs above
your Player board.


## Example:

Purple has Upgraded Designs for the
following Models:

Drivetrain from the City Car, Engine, and
Autopilot System from the Sports Car,
no Upgrades on the Truck and another
Engine from a Concept Car.

The Designs from the City Car and the
Sports Car are considered to be Tested
Designs as he has at least 1 matching
Car in his garages. The Upgraded Engine
from the Concept Car is not considered
to be Tested, because there is no
Concept Car in his garages.

He therefore scores for the value of the
Drivetrain, Engine, and Autopilot System
Car Parts shown on the Value Parts track;
6 + 5 + 4 = 15 PP.


<figure>

&

</figure>


Purple gains: 6 PP for testing the Drivetrain, 5 PP for the
tested Autopilot System, and 4 points for his tested Engine.


## The player with the most PP is the winner.

In the event of a tie, the tie-breakers are
as follows:

1\. The most Cars

2\. The most Tested Designs

3\. The most Banked Shifts

If still tied, all tied players share that
position.
