# LISBOA

A game by Vital Lacerda / 1-4 Players / 30 min per player / Ages 14+

On November 1st, 1755, on All Saints' Day, Lisboa suffered an earthquake
of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a tsunami, and 3 days of
fires. The city was almost completely destroyed.

The Marquis of Pombal, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, was the prime
minister at the time, and the king put him in charge of the reconstruction of
Lisboa.

The king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild
the city. On December 4th, 1755, little more than a month after the
catastrophe, the chief engineer of the realm, Manuel da Maia, presented his
plans to rebuild Lisboa. Maia presented five options, including abandoning
Lisboa altogether, rebuilding with recycled ruins, widening the streets, and
even building a completely new city. The chosen plan boldly proposed razing
the entire Baixa quarter and "laying out new streets without restraint".

Eugénio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel were the architects in charge of the
rebuilding.

In less than a year, the city was cleared of debris. Because the king wanted to
have a new and perfectly ordered city, he commissioned the construction of
big squares, straight, large avenues, and widened streets, with related types
of businesses as if each street had its own motto: A Baixa de Lisboa.

A game of Lisboa is set over a span of 22 years. You play the roles of
influential nobles who survived the earthquake, tsunami, and fires, and
who will help in the reconstruction and economic development of the new
city to receive graces from the king and the marquis. You will work with
the architects to build Lisboa anew in order to gain Influence, and the most
important thing of all: Wigs.
