# A VITAL LACERDA GAME

FOR 2 TO 4 PLAYERS


# RULEBOOK

"Natural disasters will soon be a thing of the past!" proclaimed Professor Sêni
Lativ, Project Chief of Meteorological Manipulation at Lightning Technologies.
Tests of his new invention, the Weather Machine, showed positive results. Visions
of quelling floods, subduing cyclones, and ending droughts made him smile.

In Weather Machine, you are scientists on Prof. Lativ's team, tampering with
control of local weather: adjusting rainfall for farms, maintaining wind and clear
skies for ecological energy sources, and tweaking the temperature for resorts or
sporting events. The prototype is quite effective so far; however, a pattern has
emerged, revealing a worrying side effect: Each use of the Weather Machine also
alters the conditions elsewhere on the planet - a "butterfly effect."

Prof. Lativ's dreams of eliminating climatic catastrophes quickly evolve
into nightmares of ending humankind. Each test causes worse side
effects. One day, the professor bursts into the lab with resolve in his eye,
followed immediately by stone-faced stoics in suits.



Government officials have accepted the urgent nature of the situation, as well as
the fact that only Prof. Lativ's team might fix the very problem he has stirred up.
"We must build a new prototype," he announces as the agents shoot him sidelong
glances; " ... but this time we're going to get it right." The agents silently give a
single, crisp nod of confirmation. "The government is funding this, and we will
succeed."

As Prof. Lativ explains the plan, the need to secure suppliers for sufficient bots
and chemicals is clear. In addition to the materials, time is of the essence; you
must be focused and efficient to have any hope of reining in his growing global
terror, Earth's atmosphere, before conditions are too harsh for Homo Sapiens and
countless other species of all biomes.

At this point, Professor Sêni Lativ will be remembered as a mad, but
brilliant, scientist for as long as humanity survives, but you could go
down in history as the savior of the world.



In Weather Machine, you take on the role of one of the Scientists working with Professor Lativ. You must manage your own Laboratory, acquiring Vouchers to spend
in other Locations, building Bots, acquiring Chemicals, and increasing the size of your Workshop where you will store resources and build prototypes. Once you have
conducted enough research into a particular type of weather, you want to publish a paper on the subject, and then build a prototype to help fix some of the extreme weather
caused by experiments made by Lativ's flawed Weather Machine. The research into those flaws will lead to breakthroughs that will help humanity to fix extreme weather
forever, getting you Awards and possibly a Nobel Prize!




# GAME SETUP

Each player chooses a color and takes all of the pieces
of that color.

1\. Place the main board in the middle of the playing
area.

2\. Each player places their Scoring marker on space 0
of the Climate Points (CP) track.

3\. Place the Investment tiles, Citation tokens, and
Award tokens next to the board in the reserve.
Place the Nobel Prize on the board.
