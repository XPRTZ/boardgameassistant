# INVENTIONS Evolution of Ideas

Game Rules


## INTRODUCTION

Since the dawn of time, humans have sought
new ideas, forever developing them into even
newer concepts. Their genius made them stand
out from the other animals. Each invention is
a veritable evolutionary step. Humans' use of
tools surpasses all others, making Homo sapiens
technologists since before historical records
were invented.

Inventions follows humanity's most noteworthy
innovations and places the power of these
technological developments in your hands to
evolve your societies over the ages.

In Inventions, cards simulate these new
concepts. They are the ideas that eventually
become inventions. Once they are invented,
they can be shared with the world, and everyone
involved in the process spreads the exciting
news. You can even share with other societies,
boosting the inventions' efficacy.

Inventions is a tactical game that revolves
around long-term strategy. Each society's
progress will be measured in Ingenuity Points
(IP). The player with the most IP has the
strongest society and wins the game.

## PLAYER COUNT DIFFERENCES

You will make minor adjustments to how you play the
game for different player counts. These will be clearly
marked as follows; you can ignore the tweaks that do
not apply to your player count:

· 8888 (4-Player games), which is the default player
count for which the rules are written.

· &&& (3-Player games)


### · && (2-Player games)

Also, the & relies on an automated opponent. Details
on this can be found at the end of the rulebook, along
with a summary of changes for easy reference.


## Setup


### MAIN BOARD

1\. Place the main board in the middle of the table.

2\. Each player chooses a color and takes 1 Era
marker, 1 Influence marker, 1 Scoring marker, and
1 Turn Order marker of that color. Place your
scoring marker on space 0 of the Ingenuity Points
(IP) track.

3\. The player who has invented something most
recently goes first. The turn order is then
clockwise, starting with this player. Place your
Turn Order markers on the Turn Order track
of the main board accordingly; the first player's
marker is placed on the top space.

4\. Place the Era marker for each player below the
Era track on the first four spaces (in any order).

5\. Place each player's Influence marker on space 1 of
the Influence track.

6\. Place the Chronos meeple on the leftmost space of
the Era track (just below

7\. Place 1 Sage meeple on the
Sage space in each region.

8\. Place 1 random Knowledge
tile face up (IP side down)
on the Knowledge space in
each region.

9\. Separate the Milestone tiles by letter. Shuffle
Deck A and place 1 tile from it face up on each
space of the Common Knowledge display.

10\. Shuffle Milestone Deck B and place 1 tile from
it face up on each of the 4 Player displays on the
board, even if that player is not in the game. This
is called the Private display.

11\. Place the 3 C Milestones face up next to the board,
making the Eureka display. Place Decks D, E, and
F above the Eureka display.

12\. Place 1 random Specialist tile face up in each
Region display, to the left of the Idea space.

13\. Separate Idea/Invention cards by Era (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6), creating a deck for each. Set aside Eras 1 and 2.

14\. Each Region display contains a Specialist tile,
which depicts a benefit. From the Era-2 Idea cards,
look for the 5 Idea cards with the letter A. Place a

## WEALTH AND PROGRESS TILES

16\. Separate the Wealth tiles by letter (3 or 4 of
each letter), and randomly place them face up on
the indicated space in each Region display to the
left of the Idea space. For each of A - D, place
a number of tiles equal to the player count. For
each of E - G, place a number that depends on the
player count:

: Place all 3 for each of E - G.

: Place any 2 for each of E - G.

Place any 2 for each of E - G.

17\. Stack the Economy , Culture , and Technology
Progress tiles separately. For each type of tile,
create 7 stacks, one for each unique number (1
through 7). Place each stack face up on any display
space for that type.

:Stack only 2 of each number on each display.

&å : Stack only 2 of each number on each display.

random one of these in each region, except the two
regions with the Specialist tiles depicted in the
lower-left illustration to the right.

15\. Separately shuffle the Idea Era 3, 4, 5, and 6 decks,
then create a single face-up Idea stack by stacking
the Era-6 ideas on the bottom, then atop those
ideas, Era 5, then Era 4, and finally Era 3 on top.
Do not shuffle the Idea stack. Place this stack next
to the main board.

## SOCIETY BOARD SETUP

A. Place 2 citizens in your academy as scholars and 1 in the Home (upper) space of each Specialty area
(economy , culture , and technology ) as specialists (trader, artisan, and thinker). The Specialty areas
are in the upper-right portion of your Society board. Place 1 of your citizens as a diplomat on your private
Milestone.

B. Sort the Private Goal cards into 3 decks by type. Take 3 Private Goal cards: 1 random card of each type. Keep
these cards secret from your opponents, but you may look at them at any time.

C. Set aside your +1 Influence 19 Influence token for now. Place your other 4 Influence tokens (Present an

, on the matching Influence spaces in the lower-right portion
of your Society board.

,
,

D. Place 1 of your Economy tokens on its space in the lower-right corner of your Society board and the other
2 Economy tokens on the matching Progress hexes on the left half of your Society board.

E. Take the idea from the Era-2 stack of Idea cards that depicts your Milestone's name (with a B below it) in its
upper-right corner. Place it to the right of your Society board.

F. In turn order, each player takes an Era-3 Idea card from the top of the Idea stack and places it to the right of
their board. Now lay the top 3 cards face up to the right of the deck to create the Idea display next to the main
board (see Setup illustration, p. 5,
15
).

G. Take 2 random inventions from the Era-1 stack of Prehistoric Invention cards (they do not have an idea on
the other side). Place them to the left of your board.

H. Place your 3 Chain Action tokens on the upper-left space of your society board.

I. Place your 3 Pillars of Time (Epoch and the 2 Seasons) near your society board.

J. Keep the 4 Aspiration tiles and your remaining citizens near your society board as your citizen supply.

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->

## Stone Age (Setup Round )

In reverse turn order (starting with the player at the
bottom of the Turn Order track), each player does the
following on their turn:

i. Choose a region with an Idea card.

Tip: If this is your first game, you may choose
your region from your Private Goal card or just for
the bonus on the Specialist tile. If you feel like you
can't yet choose wisely, just choose randomly.

ii. Depending on the region, place 1 or 2* of your
specialists matching the idea there on the Specialist
tile to the left of it ( economy : trader, culture :
artisan, technology : thinker, and/or scholars
who can do any of those things).
*As depicted on the Specialist tile to the left of the idea.

## The Core of the Game

Your goal is to put your ideas out into the world so they can become inventions and then be shared with
humankind. These are the three most crucial things that happen in the game because they allow you to gain IP
(Ingenuity Points), increase your population, and advance your society.


<figure>

SHARE INVENTION

</figure>


Note: These steps do not have to be done by the same player (more on that later)!

Tip: Over the course of a game you should try to get at least one or more Progress/ Wealth tiles each turn.
These are key to quickly advance your society to success.


<figure>
</figure>


<!-- PageNumber="7" -->

## Key Concepts

The following concepts are important to understand before you start playing the game:


### A. CHRONOS, ERA TRACK, AND MILESTONES:


<figure>
</figure>


On the Era track, Chronos' advance
depicts the ever-constant march of time;
however, the Era track also indicates each
society's accumulation of technological
advancement. If your society's Era
marker becomes ahead of Chronos' era, it
is because your society is ahead of the times. If your
Era marker lags behind Chronos, your society is
behind the times. The technological Milestones you
reach will define your society's era, and thus whether
you are ahead or behind the times.


#### SOCIETIES AHEAD AND BEHIND THE TIMES.


<figure>

?

Z4

</figure>


ORANGE IS BEHIND THE TIMES, PURPLE IS AHEAD OF THE TIMES.


### B. ASSEMBLY, FORUMS, AND ACTION SPACES:

The Assembly on the left half of the main board
provides a menu of actions for everyone to use.
The Assembly is divided into 5 forums; each forum
comprises 2 different Action spaces. To perform an
action, you will place a pillar on an Action space.


#### A FORUM OF THE ASSEMBLY


<figure>

FORUM

A

9

ACTION

ACTION

</figure>


‹‹ GOLDEN RULE »>

Each player can have only 1 Pillar of Time
(whether epoch or season) in each forum.

· This means that once you choose an action in a
forum, you are blocking yourself from both actions
in that forum until the next era, when they will
become available again.

Note: An accessible forum is a forum with none
of your Pillars of Time in it.


## C. MAIN ACTION:

During your turn, you must perform a main action.
This involves either moving your Epoch pillar (big)
to an Action space in a different accessible forum, or
playing one of your Season pillars (small) on an Action
space in any accessible forum. Chronos' position on
the Era track will indicate whether you must play a
Season pillar or move your Epoch pillar this round.
If Chronos is standing on a wheel above the current
era's space, you must play a Season pillar; if a pillar
is depicted above the current era's space, move your
Epoch pillar to a different forum.


<figure>

</figure>


<figure>

</figure>


### Example

It's the 3rd round of the era; in this round,
everyone must change epochs. Orange moves his
Epoch pillar to 1 of the 2 accessible forums (his
options are highlighted with blue) and chooses to
take the Invent action. He couldn't leave the pillar
in the same forum (not even moving to the other
Action space there) because he already has a pillar
of time on that forum (the Epoch pillar in this
case). However, notice that other players' pillars of
time do not affect which forums are accessible.


## D. CHAIN ACTION:


<figure>
</figure>


Chain Actions are all the actions marked with
a Chain Action icon and a pink background.

The number of Chain Actions you can take during
your turn is limited by your influence, as indicated
on the Influence track on the main board. Thus, the
number of Chain Actions you can perform will
change from turn to turn. At the beginning of each
turn, you prepare a number of Chain Action tokens
(1 to 3) that you can use for the turn.


### PREPARE CHAIN ACTION TOKENS


<figure>
</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


## Example

It's Blue's turn. Looking at the Influence track,
she sees that 2 Chain Action tokens are
depicted beside her Influence marker on the
Influence track. So, she will start her turn with
2 Chain Action tokens prepared.

Certain actions you take may present you with an
option to perform a Chain Action , as well; these
will be clearly marked with the Chain Action icon.
Every time you take a Chain Action , you will place
a Chain Action token close to the icon, allowing you
to track your Chain Actions as you perform them.
You don't have to use all of your allotted Chain Action
tokens, but once you run out of your allotment for the
turn, you cannot perform any more Chain Actions .
You will retrieve the used tokens after you finish the
Perform Actions step (see p.10, Playing a Round), so
you might as well use them if you can!

</figure>


<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


## Key Concepts


### E. INFLUENCE:

As mentioned earlier, your influence determines
the number of Chain Actions you can take
during your turn.


### F. EXHAUSTED CITIZENS VS. AVAILABLE CITIZENS:


<figure>
</figure>


You will deploy your citizens to advance
your society. Note that your Epoch and
Season pillars are not citizens.
Sometimes, an icon depicts a citizen
lying down, which means they are
exhausted. When that happens, you
move your citizens to the Exhausted (lower) space of
their Specialty area, lying down. When an icon depicts
a citizen standing up, they are available to work, and
you should move them to the Home (upper) space of
their specialty area. You can only deploy citizens that
are home!


<figure>
</figure>


### Example

The citizens at home (upper part of the image)
are available to work; the ones at the bottom are
exhausted and cannot be used until the next era.


### G. SPECIALISTS:

Citizens can specialize in certain skills, becoming
traders, artisans, or thinkers. Citizens' specialties
are related to the three types of Idea cards and
Progress tiles: economy , culture , and technology,
respectively. Once a citizen is assigned a specialty,
that citizen is called a specialist.

The relationship between specialists, ideas, and
progress is very strong:


<figure>

Traders drive economy .

Artisans drive culture .

Thinkers drive technology

</figure>


ARTISAN, CULTURE INVENTION, AND CULTURE PROGRESS TILE


<figure>

WRITING

</figure>


<<< FROM THE DESIGNER >>>

Connecting each type of invention to a specialty
in a logical way was a fun challenge. For example,
the Wheel appears as a technology card, Coins
appears as an economy card, and Writing appears
as a culture card. So each invention is in a fitting
specialty to indicate which type of specialist it
requires, and how it will progress your society. Each
invention is also set in the right era: You won't find
yourself inventing fire in the 17th Century, and you
won't devise electrical batteries in the Stone Age.


### H. THE ACADEMY/SCHOLARS:

Your academy hosts scholars who are resilient
citizens who can work in any specialty. Your
Milestone's era number is the maximum number of
scholars you can have at your academy .

A scholar can act as any specialist; however, when you
must exhaust the scholar, the scholar permanently commits
to a specialty: Move the scholar to the Exhausted (lower)
space of the chosen specialty's area. If you do not need to
exhaust them, the scholar remains at the academy, still
resilient and ready to take on any task.


### I. PROGRESS TILES AND WEALTH TILES:

There are 3 types of Progress tiles - economy ,
culture , and technology - as well as Wealth tiles.
Once you build these onto the Progress map on your
Society board, you can use them.


<figure>
</figure>


Each Economy tile provides you with
1
a benefit you can activate once per era
by placing an Economy token on it.
At the end of the era you get your Economy tokens
back to use next era. You start the game with 1
Economy token, but can gain more by building
progress or Wealth tiles over the spaces of your
Progress map that have Economy tokens on them.
You can only have 1 Economy tile of each number.


<figure>
</figure>


Each Culture tile provides you with
a permanent improvement to the
action depicted at the top of the tile.
Every time you perform that action, you get the
benefit depicted in the middle. You can only have 1
Culture tile of each number.


<figure>
</figure>


Each Technology tile provides you
with a paired Chain Action that
depicts 2 actions - let's call them A
1
and B. If you perform Action A, you can chain
Action B. If you perform Action B, you can chain
Action A. So, you have some flexibility. You can
only use 1 Technology tile per turn,
it costs you 1 influence, and when
you use it, you must flip it face
down, never to be used again. You
o
5
can only have 1 Technology tile of
A
3
each number.


<figure>

B

</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


Each Wealth tile provides you with
an endgame scoring goal regarding the
tiles on your Progress map. You can
only have 1 Wealth tile of each letter.

(See the player aid for a detailed explanation of each
Progress tile).

## How to Play


## How an Idea Shapes History

This is a detailed example of how an idea evolves in
Inventions. This does not get into the minutiae of each
action; rather, it is intended to help make the flow of
actions meaningful before we get into the step-by-step
instructions for The Actions.

Milestones determine how advanced your society
is, they are the building blocks of your society's
understanding. Some inventions require certain prior
knowledge of technology (Milestones). For example,
you cannot bake bread if you do not yet know how to
make fire.

First, a society conceives and Presents an Idea.
Eventually, someone will realize that mere idea by
Inventing it, assuming they have knowledge of the
appropriate Milestone already. Sometimes, another
society will Innovate upon an invention, improving it
forever. Ultimately, though, someone involved in that
process Shares the Invention with the world, and that
society strides forward in the race for wealth.

there. Although it's not necessary, Orange then
Innovates upon the Wheel (innovation is the
one optional stage of the "idea life cycle").
Finally, Blue Shares the Invention with the world,
developing his society's wealth . Because Blue
invented the idea, Blue ends up in possession of
the invention itself. As the originator of the idea,
Yellow gets credit for the Ingenuity Points (IP).
Orange's population in Asia grows, thanks to the
innovation effort. There are advantages to being
involved in any stage of the process! All of this
will be explained in detail later.

The game takes place over 6 eras:


<table>
<tr>
<td>1. Stone Age (3.2 million years ago)</td>
<td>1 Round</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Neolithic (12 thousand years ago)</td>
<td>3 Rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Metal Age (3300 BCE)</td>
<td>3 Rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Classical/Middle Age (500 BCE)</td>
<td>3 Rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Modern Age (17th Century)</td>
<td>3 Rounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Computer Age (21st Century)</td>
<td>Scoring Round</td>
</tr>
</table>


Each era consists of 3 rounds: playing your 2 Season
pillars and then moving your Epoch pillar. The
exceptions are the Stone Age (Era 1), which consists
of only 1 round, in which you only move your Epoch
pillar, and the Computer Age (Era 6), which is
exclusively endgame scoring. At the end of each era
(except Era 5), there is an era change procedure to
mark the turning of the wheel of time. All of this is
depicted in iconography along the Era track to help you
remember (see p.22, Era Change).


### ERAS

## PLAYING A ROUND

At the beginning of each round (except in Era 1), Chronos advances 1 step on the Era track. Then, each player
takes a turn that consists of a main action and, optionally, one or more Chain Actions .


### TAKING YOUR TURN

Your turn is divided into the following steps (these are depicted on your Society board, as a reminder):


<figure>

1\.

2\.

3\.

4\.

\+

</figure>


1\. PREPARE CHAIN ACTION TOKENS

2\. PERFORM ACTIONS

3\. ASPIRATIONS BECOME PROGRESS

4\. BUILD PROGRESS

Note: At the end of step 2, return
all of your Chain Action tokens
to the left space in the upper-left
corner of your Society board.


### STEP 1: PREPARE CHAIN ACTION TOKENS

Move the number of Chain Action tokens (on your Society board) indicated by your space on the Influence
track from the left space to the right space in the upper-left corner of your Society board. You will place these
as you perform Chain Actions, and you cannot take more Chain Actions than the number of

Chain Action tokens you prepared this turn. After you finish Step 2: Perform Actions, return them to the left
space again (see next page, PERFORM ACTIONS).

#### Example

Purple is starting his turn; his token is on 5 on
the Influence track. This section of the Influence
track depicts 2 Chain Action tokens to the right.
So he moves 2 of his Chain Action tokens to the
right space of his society board. He can take
2 Chain Actions this turn.

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


## STEP 2: PERFORM ACTIONS

Every time you place or move one of your Pillars of Time, you are making your mark on history, creating an essential stepping stone in the story of Inventions.
Choose wisely.

In this step, you will either play a Season pillar from
your Society board on an accessible Action space or
move your Epoch pillar to an Action space in another
accessible forum. Either way, the Action space must not
be in a forum that has one of your Pillars of Time in it,
making it accessible. Whether you play a Season pillar
or move your Epoch pillar is indicated by the space of
the Era track on which Chronos stands:


<figure>
<figcaption>PLAY A SEASON PILLAR OR MOVE YOUR EPOCH PILLAR</figcaption>
</figure>


If Chronos' space depicts the Epoch pillar, you must
move it. Otherwise he will be on a wheel space, so
you must play a Season pillar.

Reminder: In Era 1, there is only 1 round, in
which you place your Epoch pillar on the main
board. In Era 6, you take no main actions.
Otherwise, each era comprises 3 rounds. In rounds
1 - 2, play the Season pillars; in round 3, move
your Epoch pillar to a different forum. All of this is
indicated on the Era track.

Once you have played your Season pillar or moved
your Epoch pillar, you will influence other players'
Epoch pillars that are on the chosen Action space (see
below), and then perform the action.

A. Influence Epoch pillars (&8: or Season pillars)
Each player with an Epoch pillar (&8: or Season
pillars) on the Action space you chose gains 1
influence (advance 1 space on the Influence track). The
maximum influence you may have is 10.


<figure>
<figcaption>INFLUENCE EPOCH PILLARS</figcaption>
</figure>


### B. Perform the Action

Then, perform the chosen action (for what each action
does and how it works, see The Actions, p.12). You
may also perform any number of your prepared
Chain Actions for the turn.


## ASPIRATION TILES

Some actions will grant you an Aspiration tile for
either economy, culture, or technology, or even
one of your choice. Aspiration tiles are placeholders
that you will replace with Progress tiles during Step
3 of your turn (see p. 21).

When you gain an Aspiration tile, rotate it so the
symbol matching the type awarded is at the top,
then place it in the leftmost empty space of the tiles
display at the bottom of your Society board. If you
gain more Aspiration tiles than your tiles display
has empty spaces, then at the end of your turn you
must choose which of the new tiles to gain; the
excess Aspiration tiles return to your supply.


<figure>

2

</figure>


## Example

Blue's tiles display already has 3 tiles in it.
On her turn, she gains an Aspiration tile set to
technology and an Aspiration tile set to culture.
She only has room for 1. She chooses to keep the
culture tile, and returns the other to her supply.


## <<< PERFORMING A CHAIN ACTION >>>

Performing a Chain Action is almost identical to
performing your main action; but instead of using
a pillar, you place a Chain Action token close to
the Chain Action icon you wish to use.

## The Actions

Each action can be performed as a main action or as a Chain Action .
The action involves the same steps, no matter whether you perform it as a main action or as a Chain Action .

<<< IMPORTANT >>>

If (and only if) you cannot take any of the main actions, just play your Season pillar or move your Epoch pillar and gain 1 influence. Avoid this at all costs.


<figure>
</figure>


### PRESENT AN IDEA

Present the ideas that may eventually become inventions. You will be known as the presenter. This is one of the core actions in the game.


<figure>
</figure>


1\.
Place one of your Idea cards from the
right of your Society board in a Region
display with no card in it.

2\.


<figure>
</figure>


The Specialist tile (to the left
of the card you just played)
indicates the number of
specialists and/or scholars required to present
your idea in this region. Move the required 1 or 2
available specialists of the same type as the card
you played (and/or scholars) from your Society

board to stand atop the Specialist tile. Gain the
benefit depicted on the Specialist tile.


<figure>
</figure>


3\.
\+
At the end of Step 2: Perform Actions (see
p. 11), for each Idea you have presented,
T
perform the following steps (you might be
able to present multiple ideas during your turn;
don't do the following until all of them are done):

a. Select an Idea card from the Idea display (the 3
cards plus the top card of the deck next to the

main board) and place it to the right of your
Society board to fill the gap left by the idea you
just placed.

b. Slide the cards of
Slide direction
the Idea display
to the right (away
from the stack)
to fill any gaps,

and place the next
card from the stack on the newly empty space.

Orange plays the Caravel Idea card from Era 4
in Africa. The Specialist tile in Africa indicates
that 2 specialists must cooperate to create that
idea. Since Caravel is an Economy card, Orange

places a trader and chooses a scholar to place to
the left of the idea card. He gains the benefit on
the Specialist tile (3 IP). At the end of step 2, he
takes a new card from the Idea display, choosing

the card on top of the idea deck. If he had taken a
different card, he would slide the remaining cards
to close the gap, and fill the display with a new
card.

<!-- PageHeader="INVENT" -->

Inventing ideas advances your society's technology and allows the new invention to be shared with the world. This is one of the core actions in the game.

1\.


<figure>
</figure>


V
ACCESS TO MILESTONES >>>

Having access to the Milestone required to invent
an idea means any of the following is true:

Private display: The Milestone is in a player's
Private display on the board, and one of the
following is also true:

· It is in your own display.

· It is in an opponent's, and one of your citizens
is on it.

· It is in an opponent's, and it is from an era
earlier than Chronos' current era.

Common knowledge: The Milestone is on the
board in the Common Knowledge display, or has
been pushed off the board, and is in the discard.

2\.
Place an Aspiration tile on the leftmost
empty space of the tiles display at the
+
bottom of your Society board, rotated
so technology is at the top (see p. 11).

3\.

D
Move an available specialist of the
same specialty as the idea (or
move a scholar) from your
Society board to the Invent space to the right of the
idea (same icon as this action). An idea may also
require you to exhaust additional specialists (and/
or scholars) for you to invent it. This requirement
will be depicted to the left of the Invent space (on
the card), next to the required Milestone. If so,
exhaust specialists of the type indicated there (and/
or scholars).


### EXHAUSTING SPECIALISTS >>>

Remember: To exhaust a specialist, simply move
the citizen from the Home (upper) space of the
specialty area to the Exhausted (lower) space, and
lay it down. This specialist is no longer available
until the specialist returns home.

TIP: You can tell that a card on the board is still
an idea if it has no citizens standing to its right.

#### Example

Yellow wants to invent the Steamboat, a radical
Era-5 idea rumored to exist in Asia. To invent
the Steamboat, she must already know about
Iron. Iron has become common knowledge, so
she will be able to run with the idea and invent

the Steamboat. She sends 1 trader to Asia to
invent it, but as the Steamboat indicates, a second
trader must be exhausted, as well. Both traders
are required for the invention process. Inventing
gives Yellow's society a boost in technology , so

she takes an Aspiration tile set to technology
Finally, Yellow flips the card over. The Steamboat
has been invented!

INNOVATE

Innovating on someone else's invention brings new specialists to your society. This action allows you to take a Chain Action .

Note: You can only innovate on inventions; you cannot innovate on mere ideas. If it is not an invention yet (no citizen on the top space to the right of the card), or
if you were the inventor, you cannot take this action. You will see a reminder about this on the board above the Innovate space.

##### Example

Purple wants to innovate upon the Seawall that
was invented in the Middle East, but he can't
because he is the one who invented it. But African
Silk is available to be innovated upon. Silk is an
economy invention, so Purple sends a trader to

innovate upon that invention. Because Silk is now
improved through innovation, Purple attracts 1
new Trader specialist. Since he still has a Chain
Action token to spend, he takes the "Share an
Invention" Chain Action in the lower-right

corner of Silk (beside the trader he just placed),
sharing it with the world immediately. With this
Chain Action , Purple could have shared any
invention on the board he is part of; it didn't have
to be Silk (see p. 15).

## SHARE AN INVENTION

Sharing an invention advances your societal wealth, increases the innovator's population, gives the invention card to the inventor, and earns IP for the idea's
original presenter. Sharing a mere idea impresses no one; you must share an invention. This is one of the core actions in the game.

Note: If you do not have citizens beside any inventions, you cannot take this action. Remember that an invention will have its Chain Action at the bottom of the card,
and at least 1 citizen to its right (if this is not the case, it is a mere idea, and you cannot take this action). You must have a citizen beside the invention in order to share it.

Choose an invented idea on any Region display
where you have a citizen next to the card as either the
presenter, the inventor, or the innovator.

1\.


<figure>
</figure>


The presenter (the
:
8

player whose citizens
are to the left of the
invention) scores IP equal to the era of the
invention, as indicated in the lower-left corner of
the card, for each of their citizens to the left of
the card.

invention to the left of

You (the player sharing the
invention) take either any 1
Wealth tile from this region, or an Aspiration tile
set to Wild (see right), and place it in the leftmost
empty space of your tiles display. If your tiles
display has no empty spaces for it, either replace
any Aspiration tile in your tiles display, or do not
take the tile at all.

All of the citizens that were beside the invention are
moved into the matching region on the map.

MARINER'S COMPASS

</figure>


### Example

Blue decides to share his own Mariner's Compass
Era-4 idea from Australia that has become an
invention. He has 2 citizens that presented the idea,
Yellow has 1 citizen who invented it, and Orange
has 1 who innovated upon it. Blue earns 8 IP (4
per citizen). Orange, as the innovator, also adds a
citizen from her supply to the map region. Because
Yellow is the inventor, she moves the invention to
the left of her Society board. Blue then chooses a
Wealth tile beside the invention and adds it to his
tiles display. Finally, all 4 of these citizens move to
the matching region on the map.

Note: You can only ever have 1 Wealth tile of
each letter, so if you already have a Wealth tile
of the same letter as the one you wish to take, or
there are no more Wealth tiles in the region, or
you just don't want one, you may instead take an
Aspiration tile set to wild: Place an Aspiration tile
on the leftmost empty space of the tiles display
at the bottom of your Society board, but rotate it
so the question mark is standing upright (i.e. no
single color is at the top). This is to remind you
that you get to choose the type of Progress tile that
replaces it (see p. 11).

## CALL SPECIALISTS

All societies need specialists to advance and progress. Independent of their time, societies always look for geniuses to help their growth and develop their
economy. This action allows you to take a Chain Action .

This action brings citizens from one region back home, available to work. This also advances your society's economy.


<figure>
</figure>


1\.
Place an Aspiration tile on the leftmost
+
empty space of the tiles display at the
bottom of your Society board, rotated so
economy is at the top.

2\.

Choose 1 region and return 1 or more
of your citizens from that map region
(not the Region display) home to the specialty area
matching the idea/invention in the region from
which they returned. If there isn't a card in the

region, their specialty is determined by the
rightmost card of the Idea display. In the rare
case that there also are no Idea cards in the display,
you choose their specialty; however, they must all
go to the same specialty. In any case, they go to the
Home (upper) portion of the specialty area, so they
are available.

3\.

If you have any Chain Action tokens
remaining, you may perform a Chain Action

from any one of the inventions to the left of your
Society board. If you do so, place a Chain Action
token on the card.

Note: If you perform more than one Call
Specialists action in a single turn, you cannot chain
the same invention's action twice.

First, he adds an Aspiration tile to his display,
set to economy . Then he chooses a region, and
decides to bring all of his citizens there home.
Since the invention in that region is a Culture
card, all of these citizens come home as artisans.
Then, for the final step of Call Specialists, he

uses his second and final Chain Action token
to choose one of the inventions to the left of his
board and performs the Chain Action near the
bottom of that card. A good turn, with no waste!

## GAIN INFLUENCE

Throughout history, societies increased their power and influence by numerous means. From war, to diplomacy; from small communities assembling, to
modern global conferences. This action represents those events. This action allows you to take a Chain Action .

This action allows you to gain influence and IP using your specialists' work in a region.


<figure>
</figure>


1\.
Choose a region where you do not have an
Influence token (no player can have 2
Influence tokens on the same region), and
where you have more citizens on that region than
anyone else, and where you have at least as many
citizens as the number depicted on your Society
board above the Influence token you wish to place
in the region (it can be any Influence token on your
Society board).


<figure>

2\.
?

</figure>


:
The number of citizens
depicted above the chosen
Influence token return home from the map (not the
Region display) to the specialty area matching the
idea/invention in the region from which they
returned. If there isn't a card in the region, their
specialty is determined by the rightmost card of the
Idea display. In the rare case that there also are no
Idea cards in the display, you choose their specialty;
however, they must all go to the same specialty. In
any case, they go to the Home (upper) portion of the
specialty area, so they are available.


<figure>

3\.

</figure>


×
Place the chosen Influence
token on the leftmost empty
Influence space in the region
(above/below the card space) and gain the IP you
cover. Gain influence equal to the number of face-up
Influence tokens you have on the board.

4\.

If you have any Chain Action tokens
remaining, you may perform the
Chain Action on one of your face-up
Influence tokens from any region. If you do so,
permanently flip the used Influence token face
down, and place a Chain Action token atop it.

### Example

In Africa, Blue wants to place the Influence token
that allows her to Present an Idea as a Chain
Action . She does not yet have an Influence token

there, so this is allowed. Above the token on her
Society board, it shows that she needs at least 2
citizens in the region. She has 3 citizens in Africa,

and she has the plurality: she has more citizens
there than anyone else. So, she can perform this
action.

Blue must bring 2 of her citizens home from Africa

under development, so she looks at the rightmost
card of the Idea display: culture . So these 2 citizens
come home as artisans, eager to work.

Blue places the Influence token on the leftmost
space of the region and scores 6 IP. Because she
now has 2 Influence tokens face up on regions of
the map, she gains 2 influence on the Influence
track. Then she decides to use her available

Chain Action token to flip the Influence token
she just placed, and perform a Present Idea
action. She could have flipped her other available
Influence token as the Chain Action .

## TRAVEL

For millennia, there was no better way to share discoveries, inventions, culture, and knowledge between societies than traveling among the civilizations of the
world. This action allows you to take a Chain Action .

Traveling improves your society's culture and allows you to learn from the sages you encounter.


<figure>

3\.

</figure>


If a sage is in the new region and
you still have a Chain Action
token, you may place it near the
AD
Knowledge tile and do one of the following as a
Chain Action :

· If the Knowledge tile shows a Chain Action ,
perform that action, then flip the Knowledge tile to
the scoring side.

OR

· If the tile is showing its 2-IP side, gain the IP of
each Knowledge tile on the map showing its 2-IP
side. Then flip all Knowledge tiles to the non-IP
side (not just those with sages above them).

Then, in either case, move the sage from that region to
the academy on your Society board.


### <<< DESIGNER NOTE ›››

The regions on the map are numbered according to
one popular understanding of prehistoric human
migration. Although new findings constantly
change our perspective on the spread of Homo
sapiens around the globe, to design a game, many
choices and abstractions must be made.

This particular choice works very well because, in
a 2-player game, these region numbers also serve
as your virtual opponent's path around Earth.


### Example

Purple can
move from South
America to North
America or Africa.
Yellow can move
from North
America to Asia, Europe, or South America,
following the ropes. Purple cannot move from
South America to Europe, because there is no
connection.

### Example

Purple travels from Europe to Africa, where
a sage is waiting for him. After adding an
Aspiration tile, with the culture side up, to his
tiles display, he uses his available Chain Action
token to flip the Knowledge tile and takes its
benefit. If in a later turn, Blue moved to the same

region while the sage is not there, she couldn't
take the Chain Action from the Knowledge tile,
but would still get the Aspiration tile ( culture
side up).

In a subsequent Era, the sage returns to Africa.

Blue notices that and travels there, receives the
Aspiration tile, and uses one of her Chain Action
tokens to get the benefit of the Knowledge tile.
Since the Knowledge tile is showing the IP side, she
flips all 4 tiles (i.e., in every region) with the IP
side up and gets 8 IP.

## EUREKA

Eureka moments are rare, but they can propel a society into a new era, acting as a gateway to numerous further inventions. With a shout of "Eureka!" a
society gets ahead of the times.

You can only perform this action if the Milestones of the Eureka display are from a later era than your private Milestone.

Move the bottommost card out
¿
of the Common Knowledge
display, and splay it on the
discard pile. Then, move your private Milestone to
the Common Knowledge display along with any
diplomats on it, inserting it above all Milestone tiles
with the same or an earlier Deck letter on it (shift
the earlier ones downward to make room).

Whenever a Milestone leaves the Common
Knowledge display: All citizens that were on it are
returned to their owners' Society boards as scholars.

Limit: Your Milestone's era number is the
maximum number of scholars you can have at your
academy . Any beyond that return to your supply;
however, with Eureka, you use the new Milestone's
era as your academy maximum.

If your old Milestone's letter is earlier than even the
bottommost Milestone in the Common Knowledge
display, splay it on the discard pile. Keep all
discards' names still visible.

### Example

Orange moves his Cotton Milestone to the
Common Knowledge display with the diplomat
still on it. Cotton is from Era B, and the
Common Knowledge display already has Sailing,
a Milestone from Era C, so he slides down all

Milestones from the previous eras to keep it
organized by alphabet. Then he takes the Crane
Milestone and places it on his personal display
with a new citizen on top. Now the new Milestone
pushes his Society to a new Era. He moves his

Era marker token to the Era indicated by the new
Milestone and chooses the Present an Idea benefit,
which he takes immediately.

## SEND DIPLOMAT

Send a diplomat to another society to learn about their new technology.

This action allows you to send any available citizen as a diplomat. The citizen can either be used to gain knowledge of a society's Milestone or a Common Knowledge
Milestone. Regardless of the method used, you benefit from the milestone where your diplomat is placed.

If the Milestone belongs to another player and is
from a more advanced era than yours, that player
gains 1 influence.

## CALL DIPLOMAT

Bring a diplomat home. Having completed their assignment, the diplomat returns as an academic, eager to demonstrate what they learned about the new
technology while away.

This allows you to use the action of the Milestone your diplomat is studying one last time.

## TAKING YOUR TURN (continued from page 11)

<<< DESIGNER TIP >>>

Once everyone is familiar with this procedure, you
can complete Steps 3 and 4 (below) while the next
player starts their turn; this speeds up the game play!


<figure>

2

</figure>


### STEP 3: ASPIRATIONS BECOME PROGRESS

During your turn, you may have accumulated several
Aspiration tiles, which serve as placeholders for
specific types of Progress tiles. Now is the time to
replace them with actual Progress tiles. (See the player
aid for a detailed explanation of each Progress tile).


<figure>

6

G

Economy

Culture

Technology

WILD

</figure>


Replace each Aspiration tile in the tiles display at the
bottom of your society board with any Progress tile
of the same type from the display. You can replace
wild Aspiration tiles with any Progress tile. Return the
replaced Aspiration tiles to your personal supply.

Remember that you can only have 1 tile of each
number/letter.

Note: This placeholder approach minimizes
disruptions to your turn and train of thought
because you do not need to stop what you are
doing to choose among the 7 types of Progress
tiles each time.


### STEP 4: BUILD PROGRESS

During this step, you may use your available specialists
to build any tiles from your tiles display onto your
Progress map, developing your society.

1\. If you wish to build any tiles this turn, first you
have to pay a one-time cost of influence based on
how many tiles are in your tiles display. This cost
is unrelated to how many tiles you actually intend
to build.

a. 4 tiles + you do not have to pay any influence.

b. 3 tiles + you must pay 1 influence.

c. 2 tiles + you must pay 2 influence.

d. 1 tile + you must pay 3 influence.

As a reminder, the influence cost is indicated on the
leftmost empty space of your tiles display.

### Example

At the beginning of the game, everyone's Era
marker and Milestones are Era 2, so at first,
everyone can build 1 tile (Era 2 - 1 = 1).

3\. For each tile you wish to build, perform these
steps:

a. Place the tile on any space on your Progress
map that has no tile in it, and immediately gain
the benefit from that space.

Note: Because you gain the benefit immediately,
you may use it to pay for the following step.

b. Pay the placement cost in specialists/scholars:

i. If this is an Economy, Culture, or
Technology tile, you must exhaust
specialists of the same type (or scholars).
If this is a Wealth tile, you may exhaust
specialists of any mix of types (or scholars).

ii. As a base cost, you must exhaust 1 specialist.
If you are placing a Wealth tile, you must
instead exhaust 2 specialists.

iii. Additionally, you must exhaust 1 more
specialist for each previously placed tile
directly adjacent to the new tile.

iv. Reduce the total cost for this tile by 1 for
each Invention card you have to the left of
your Society board that is the same type as
the tile.

Note: Wealth tiles get no such discount because
they don't have a related invention!

Check your society board for a reminder of these steps.

### Example

Purple decides to build his tiles. Since he has 3
tiles on his display, it will cost him 1 Influence
to build. His position is on Era 3, so he is able to
build up to 2 tiles (3 - 1 = 2).

### Example

Yellow decides to build 1 Technology tile. She
places it adjacent to 2 other tiles. To do so, she
would normally need to exhaust 3 thinkers. 1
thinker for the Technology tile she is building
plus 2 more for the 2 tiles it's adjacent to
(regardless of their types). However, at the left
of her Society board, she has 1 Technology
invention. Because the invention is the same type
as the tile she's placing, she reduces the number
of thinkers she needs by 1. Yellow exhausts
1 thinker and 1 scholar to build her society's
progress this turn.

turn, advance Chronos to the next
space of the Era track. If Chronos
is still in the same era, continue

after you've all moved your Epoch pillars), perform the
following steps:

1\.

a
Adjust turn order: If at least one player's
Era marker is on a Change Position in
Turn Order space on the Era track, the player
whose marker is on the furthest right Turn Order
space moves their Turn Order marker to the space
of their choice, and shifts the other Turn Order
markers to fill the gap while maintaining their
relative order. If no player is on a Turn Order
space, skip this step.

· At 1-3 influence, nothing happens.

· At 4-7, you lose 1.

· At 8-10, you lose 2.

Era 1 -> 2: If you are changing from Era 1 to Era 2,
skip the rest of the steps (this exception is depicted
on the Era track as a reminder).

3\.

All exhausted
specialists
become
available again: Move all
exhausted specialists to their
corresponding homes.

Retrieve Season pillars. Your Epoch pillar
remains on the board.

Sages inspire study: For each sage on
your society board, place a citizen from
your supply on your academy as a
scholar. Remember, your Milestone's era number is
the maximum number of scholars you can have.
Return each sage to an empty sage space on the
main board.

Retrieve Economy tokens: Return any
Economy tokens that you placed on
Economy Progress tiles back to their spaces in the
lower-right corner of your Society board.

5\.

Milestones from the previous era
become public: Move all Milestone
tiles remaining in the Eureka display
?
(if any) into the Common Knowledge display. For
each Milestone that is pushed out of the bottom,
splay it on the discard pile so the names of the
discarded Milestones are still visible. All citizens
on it return to their owners' Society boards as
scholars. Your Milestone's era number is the
maximum number of scholars you can have at your
academy ; any beyond that return to your supply.
Reveal the next set of Milestones from the next Era
stack.

3 : If there are any Milestone tiles remaining
on the Eureka display, first, move the non-player
private Milestone to the Common Knowledge
display, then replace it with the rightmost
Milestone of the Eureka display.

## Example

In transitioning from Era 2 to Era 3, there is
still 1 Era-3 Milestone remaining in the Eureka
display. So, all Milestones in the Common
Knowledge display shift 1 space downward to
make room for it. The previous bottom tile of the
Common Knowledge display leaves the board, and
ends up splayed on the discard so all Milestone
names are still visible. Then the 3 Milestones
from Era 4 (Stack D) go face up to fill the
Eureka display.

Untended ideas get invented by some
"lesser-known" societies: Discard all
Idea cards from the previous era that
are in the Idea display. In turn order, check the
Idea cards to the right of your Society board, and
discard ideas from the previous era. For each card
you discard, take a new one from the display.
Discarded Idea cards can be removed from the
game, they are no longer relevant.

### 2-Player Rules


## SETUP

You are playing a &&& against Chronos. Set up
accordingly with the following changes for Chronos:

1\. Choose a color for Chronos, and create a supply
of his citizens, Influence tokens, Era marker, Turn
Order marker, and 1 Season pillar. Assign the
players' and Chronos' starting turn order at random.

· He does not use the Epoch pillar (he always
performs 1 of 4 core actions per round), and he

does not take any Chain Actions .

· He does not use a society board, Aspiration tiles,
Influence marker, or score marker.

· Chronos will always take his ideas directly from
the Idea display rather than having 2 that are his.

2\. Place Chronos' Season pillar in Africa unless Africa
is already occupied by another player or there isn't
an Idea card from Era 2 there. In that case, place

Chronos' Season pillar in the next available region
after Africa, following the migration path numbers
depicted on each region.

3\. As usual, place the required 1 or 2 specialists to the
left of his starting idea, put 1 citizen in that region on
the map, and place any one of his Influence tokens
face down on leftmost (highest-value) space above/
below the card.

For each of E-G, place any 2.

6\. For Economy , Culture , and Technology tiles:
stack only 2 of each number on each display.


## HOW TO PLAY

You have the same rules as in a 3- or 4-player game,
except you also receive influence when an opponent
performs a main action on the same Action space
as your Season pillars (see A. Influence Epoch
pillars, p. 11).

All of Chronos' citizens are scholars (with no academy
limit), and he only ever needs to use 1 scholar when
inventing, ignoring how many are printed on the
card. He also has access to all private Milestones on
the game board, common knowledge Milestones, and
Milestones in the discard, not just his own.

On Chronos' turn, move his Season pillar to the next
region in the migration path (e.g. if it's in Region 4, move
it to Region 5, from region 7 move it to region 1) and try to
perform one of these four actions, preferring:

Present an Idea > Invent > Share > Innovate :


<figure>

I

PRESENT IDEA

INVENT IDEA

SHARE
INVENTION

INNOVATE
INVENTION

</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


## I PRESENT AN IDEA

· If this region already has an idea, skip this action
(Chronos tries to Invent the idea).

Take the rightmost idea from the Idea display and place
it in the region. Place the required 1 or 2 of his citizens
on the Specialist tile to the left of the idea. Chronos
does not receive the bonus from the Specialist tile.
Remember: Chronos always has the matching
specialist type because all of his citizens are scholars.


<figure>
</figure>


D
INVENT

· If this region already has an invention, skip this
action (Chronos will try to Share the invention).

Chronos' citizens are all scholars, and he only needs
1 to invent (he ignores any additional exhaustion
required). He takes a Progress tile from the display
matching the type of idea he invented and the region
number. This is different from the usual procedure.

However, he cannot invent the idea if the required
Milestone has not yet made it onto the board. If this
occurs, he moves his pillar to the next region and go
through the actions list starting from the beginning again.

If no Progress tiles of that region number remain,
or if he already has a tile with the same number, he
looks for a tile matching the next region number, and
then the next one until he can take one. Discard the
Progress tile and place it next to his supply.


<figure>
</figure>


## SHARE AN INVENTION

· If Chronos cannot Share an Invention in this
region, skip this action (Chronos tries to
Innovate).

As usual, Chronos can only share inventions that he
either presented, invented, or innovated. He does not
score IP. As usual, move all citizens from the invention
to the connected region following the normal rules.
Then he discards the topmost Wealth tile from the
stack and places it next to his supply. If there are
none left, he takes a Progress tile matching the type
of invention he shared and the region number. If no
Progress tiles of that region number remain, he looks
for a tile matching the next region number, and next
until he can take one.

· If he was the inventor, he simply discards the card.

· If he was the innovator, he places a new citizen in
the map region.


<figure>
</figure>


## INNOVATE

· If Chronos cannot Innovate, skip this action; move
his pillar to the next region in the migration path,
and once again go through the list of actions until
you find one he can perform.

As usual, place a citizen from Chronos' supply on the
Innovate space. Chronos never performs the Chain
Action from an Innovate action.

Once Chronos takes one of the above actions, his turn
ends.


## ALTERATIONS TO ERA CHANGE

Before doing any of the Era Change steps, first do the
following:

1\. Chronos places one of his Influence tokens on the
main board.

To determine where to place it, check where his
Season pillar is on the map. Without moving his
Season pillar, if Chronos doesn't have an Influence
token in the next region in the migration path, place
one of Chronos' Influence tokens in the leftmost
space in that region. If Chronos already has an
Influence token in that region or no spaces are empty,
check the next region, and so on, until Chronos can
place an Influence token. Move the Season pillar to
that region.

2\. In each era change except after Era 1 and before
Era 6, Chronos will take a new Milestone, and
advance his Era marker on the Era track. Take
Chronos' current Milestone and place it in the
Common Knowledge display, sliding the others
down as usual. Take the rightmost Milestone of the
Eureka display and place it on Chronos' private
Milestone space. Move Chronos' marker on the Era
track to the era matching his Milestone, placing
it in the rightmost available space. (If Chronos'
marker ends up on the rightmost Turn Order
space with an Era marker on it, he will adjust turn
order to put himself first if possible during the Era
Change steps.) Follow the usual Era Change steps
(see p. 22); when moving Milestones in Step 5, use
the rules for a

## A GLIMPSE OF TIME


## MILESTONES

Technology milestones determine how advanced your society is, they are the building blocks of your society's understanding; but milestones also serve as
stepping stones. Some inventions require certain prior knowledge (milestones). For example, you cannot bake bread if you do not yet know how to make fire.
Here you can learn a bit more about the milestones we selected to include in this game.


### A: STONE AGE (BEGAN 3.2 MILLION YEARS AGO)


<figure>
</figure>


The Australopithecus, the earliest
human species, learned to create stone
A
and bone tools, while Homo erectus
discovered how to control fire, and
Homo habilis used their backs for
transportation. Homo sapiens, our own
species, invented language by creating recognizable
sounds. These milestones represent the evolution of
human ingenuity and invention over time.


### C: METAL AGE (BEGAN 3300 BCE)


<figure>
</figure>


Iron was utilized by the Hittites, while
the Babylonians and Egyptians applied
C
arithmetic, geometry, and algebra for
taxation and other financial purposes.
By 5500 BCE, the Egyptians were
already sailing, establishing the
groundwork for the numerous inventions of the Bronze
and Iron ages that followed.


### E: MODERN AGE (BEGAN 17TH CENTURY)


<figure>
</figure>


The modern era brought forth a
multitude of inventions and advanced
E
technologies, including electricity
discovered by Benjamin Franklin in
1752 and further developed by
scientists like Michael Faraday,
Alexandro Volta, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla.
Communication breakthroughs include the telegraph
invented by Claude Chappe in 1792 and later replaced
by Samuel Morse's electric telegraph in 1837. Edward
Jenner's vaccination against smallpox in 1798 is
considered a milestone in medicine. Finally, Nikolaus
Otto's internal combustion engine, created in 1876,
was the first alternative to the steam engine.


### B: NEOLITHIC (BEGAN 12 THOUSAND YEARS AGO)


<figure>
</figure>


Players begin the game with these
milestones. Agriculture was in use by
B
the Sumerians between 12 to 11
thousand years ago. The Indus planted
cotton in Mehrgarh, located in
modern-day Pakistan, around 5000
BCE, and the Anatolians were smelting copper at the
same time in modern-day Serbia. The Egyptians began
actively mining for ores and stone before 3500 BCE.
These were the discoveries we chose to carry the
game from Ancient Times into the Metal Age.


### D: CLASSICAL/MIDDLE AGE (BEGAN 500 BCE)


<figure>
</figure>


During the Classical Age, significant
progress was made in various fields,
D
including science, philosophy, and
mathematics. The Middle Ages saw a
decline in advancement but picked up
again during the Renaissance, with
notable breakthroughs in art and science. The Chinese
created paper around 200 BCE, and the Byzantines
used explosives known as "Greek fire" in the 7th
century. The Greeks pioneered the use of cranes, and
the Romans built upon that innovation.


### F: COMPUTER AGE (21ST CENTURY)


<figure>
</figure>


With the advent of advanced
technologies such as the Internet, solar
F
panels, artificial intelligence, multi-use
rockets, and quantum computers, the
pace of technological progress has
accelerated significantly. While some
may find it daunting, others are thrilled by the
possibilities it presents. Inventions and technological
advancements have always played a critical role in
shaping our societies, determining the course of our
present, and setting the stage for our near future.


## INVENTIONS

Inventions set the pace of the game. In the list below, you can find some information about the inventions you will create in the game.
