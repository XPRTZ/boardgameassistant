# A VITAL LACERDA GAME

FOR 2 TO 4 PLAYERS


# RULEBOOK

"Natural disasters will soon be a thing of the past!" proclaimed Professor Sêni
Lativ, Project Chief of Meteorological Manipulation at Lightning Technologies.
Tests of his new invention, the Weather Machine, showed positive results. Visions
of quelling floods, subduing cyclones, and ending droughts made him smile.

In Weather Machine, you are scientists on Prof. Lativ's team, tampering with
control of local weather: adjusting rainfall for farms, maintaining wind and clear
skies for ecological energy sources, and tweaking the temperature for resorts or
sporting events. The prototype is quite effective so far; however, a pattern has
emerged, revealing a worrying side effect: Each use of the Weather Machine also
alters the conditions elsewhere on the planet - a "butterfly effect."

Prof. Lativ's dreams of eliminating climatic catastrophes quickly evolve
into nightmares of ending humankind. Each test causes worse side
effects. One day, the professor bursts into the lab with resolve in his eye,
followed immediately by stone-faced stoics in suits.



Government officials have accepted the urgent nature of the situation, as well as
the fact that only Prof. Lativ's team might fix the very problem he has stirred up.
"We must build a new prototype," he announces as the agents shoot him sidelong
glances; " ... but this time we're going to get it right." The agents silently give a
single, crisp nod of confirmation. "The government is funding this, and we will
succeed."

As Prof. Lativ explains the plan, the need to secure suppliers for sufficient bots
and chemicals is clear. In addition to the materials, time is of the essence; you
must be focused and efficient to have any hope of reining in his growing global
terror, Earth's atmosphere, before conditions are too harsh for Homo Sapiens and
countless other species of all biomes.

At this point, Professor Sêni Lativ will be remembered as a mad, but
brilliant, scientist for as long as humanity survives, but you could go
down in history as the savior of the world.



In Weather Machine, you take on the role of one of the Scientists working with Professor Lativ. You must manage your own Laboratory, acquiring Vouchers to spend
in other Locations, building Bots, acquiring Chemicals, and increasing the size of your Workshop where you will store resources and build prototypes. Once you have
conducted enough research into a particular type of weather, you want to publish a paper on the subject, and then build a prototype to help fix some of the extreme weather
caused by experiments made by Lativ's flawed Weather Machine. The research into those flaws will lead to breakthroughs that will help humanity to fix extreme weather
forever, getting you Awards and possibly a Nobel Prize!




# GAME SETUP

Each player chooses a color and takes all of the pieces
of that color.

1\. Place the main board in the middle of the playing
area.

2\. Each player places their Scoring marker on space 0
of the Climate Points (CP) track.

3\. Place the Investment tiles, Citation tokens, and
Award tokens next to the board in the reserve.
Place the Nobel Prize on the board.


## LOCATION 5 - LATIV'S OFFICE

4\. Place the Turn Order marker for each player in a
random order on the current turn order spaces.
This determines the turn order at the start of the
game.


## LOCATION I - SUPPLY

5\. Place the Initiative markers on their spaces in the
same order as the Turn Order markers.

6\. In turn order, each player places their Scientist on
the action spaces from left to right.

7\. Place Lativ on his space in Supply.


8\. Place the Chemicals on their matching spaces.

9\. Shuffle the Workshop tiles and place 4 of them at
random on the board. Separate the remaining tiles
into two equal stacks, placing one face up and the
other face down.


### LOCATION 2 - GOVERNMENT

10\. Shuffle the Subsidy tiles and place them at
random, blue-side up, on the spaces as shown.


11\. Place the 10
Government Research
tokens (blue) in stacks
of the same type on the
indicated spaces.

12\. Place the 3 Government markers on their proper
space.

13\. Place all the Machine Parts next to the main
board in the reserve.

14\. Each player places one of their Funding markers
on the leftmost space of the Government
Funding track.


#### LOCATION 3 - LATIV'S LAB

15\. Separate the Experiment tiles by Stage (I, II, III)
and shuffle each Stage separately, keeping the
tiles face-down. From the Stage III tiles, choose
3 at random and return them to the box unseen.
Then create a single face-down deck by placing
the Stage I tiles first, the Stage II tiles on top,
and lastly the remaining 2 Stage III tiles on top.
Finally, flip the entire deck face up and place it
on the indicated space.

16\. Place the top 3 tiles of the Experiment deck in
the 3 spaces to the right of the deck (the display).
Then place the next tile from the Experiment
deck in the space below the deck.

17\. Place the Assistant below the Machine branch
indicated by the weather on the tile on top of the
Experiment deck. In the setup image, the top tile
on the Experiment deck depicts Wind, therefore
the Assistant is placed in the Wind branch.

18\. Place Lativ's 5 Bots to the side of the Lab.
2-Player Game: Place 1 of Lativ's Bots on the
bottom space of each branch of the Machine.


19\. Place the 15 Lab Research tokens (green) in stacks
of the same type on the indicated spaces.

2-3 Player game: Use only 2 of each type.

20\. Place a Lock token on each of the 5 Citation spaces.

on the leftmost space of the Lab Funding track.


# LOCATION 4 - R&D

22\. Separate the Extreme Weather tiles by type and
place the Level 1 tiles on their indicated places on
the board.

23\. Place the other Extreme Weather tiles in stacks by
type next to the main board with the Level 2 tiles
on top of the Level 3 tiles.



24\. Place the 10 R&D Research tokens (lilac) in
stacks of the same type on the indicated spaces.

25\. Each player places one of their Funding markers
on the leftmost space of the R&D Funding track.


# Action spaces in 2-player games

Place a Voucher marker of
a non-player color on the
rightmost action space of each
Main Location (2,3,4). That
space cannot be used during
the game.


Workshop with spaces for a Chemical, a Machine Part, and a Bot.

Bot Assembly Line

Voucher tracks starting positions


## Office


# PLAYER'S LABORATORY

Each player sets up their own Laboratory as follows:

a. Your Assembly Line is divided into 4 sections, each with 3 spaces. Place your 12 Bots on these spaces.

b. Place your Voucher markers on the starting positions of each of your Voucher tracks as follows:

4 Supply, 1 Government, 1 Lab, 1 R&D, and 2 Science.

c. Place your Breakthrough markers on their spaces to the right side of your Office.

d. Take 1 Machine Part of each color and give one at random to each player, returning any leftovers back to the
reserve. Place your Machine Part on the space in the middle row of your Workshop.

e. Take 1 Workshop tile from the top of the face-down stack per player and give one at random to each player.
Place your tile next to the middle row of your Workshop, oriented so that the colored half-circles are at the
top and bottom.

f. Take a random set of 9 Goal tiles (ones with the same symbol in the bottom left corner) and place them face
up below your Laboratory.

Note: Page 23 contains a variant rule for expert Goal drafting which replaces step f.


# VOUCHERS

Scientists spend and receive Vouchers from Lightning Technologies to access other locations and be able to continue their
crucial work.

Your Voucher markers track how many Vouchers you
currently have of each type. Vouchers are gained by
moving your Scientist to a Location and also spent at
other Locations to perform actions.

Whenever you gain a Voucher, move the corresponding
marker up. Whenever you pay a Voucher, move the
marker down.

You can only gain a Voucher if you have space for it.
If you do not, gain only what you can.


You can never pay what you do not
have. However, Science Vouchers may be
spent as if they were any other type of
Voucher.


# YOUR WORKSHOP

Scientists must increase the size of their Workshop as they require more and more space for holding chemicals, bots,
and to build bigger branches of their prototype machines.


At the start of the game, your Workshop consists of
the 3 spaces on the right side of your Laboratory and
your first Workshop tile. This will increase in size as
you add new Workshop tiles to it.

Your Workshop is where you store your Bots,
Chemicals, and Machine Parts. Whenever you gain
one of these, you must immediately store it in your
Workshop. If you do not have space for something,
you cannot gain it.

You also build your prototypes in your Workshop
with your Machine Parts.

The space in the top left of your Workshop can hold
1 Chemical of any type. Other Chemicals are stored
on a matching colored space formed by two adjacent
Workshop tiles (one per space).

The space in the middle left of your Workshop can
hold 1 Machine Part of any type. Other Machine
Parts are stored on Workshop tiles (one per space).

The space in the bottom left of your Workshop can
hold 1 Bot. Other Bots are stored on Workshop tiles
(one per space).

Note: A Workshop tile can only store 1 Machine
Part OR 1 Bot.

Bots, Chemicals, and Machine Parts may be moved
around your Workshop at any time (including
swapping the positions of two items), as long as each
one is moved to a legal space.

Workshop tiles cannot be moved or rotated after
placement.

Note: You may not remove a Bot, Chemical, or
Machine Part from your Workshop unless you
are explicitly allowed to do so. I.e., if you gain a
Chemical and have no space for it, you cannot
remove another Chemical from your Workshop to
make space.

Whenever you pay a Machine Part, return it to the
reserve. Chemicals are either returned to the Supply
or placed in R&D when spent (as indicated by the
action). Bots are never spent, but instead moved to
spaces on the board as determined by your chosen
action.




# GAME STRUCTURE

After an initial Supply round (see next page), the game is played over a series of
rounds, with each round divided into 3 Phases.

PHASE A: Player Turns. In turn order, each player takes a turn.

PHASE B: Run Weather Machine experiment.

PHASE C: End of Round. Adjust turn order. Possible income.

This continues until the end of the game is triggered (see page 22). After final
scoring, the player with the most CP is the winner.


# EXECUTIVE EXCHANGES

To help the Scientists work efficiently, Lightning Technologies allows them to exchange vouchers to speed up their research by granting them some advantages.

You can perform the following Executive Exchanges during the game:


## SCIENCE EXCHANGE

?
Whenever you need to pay
a Voucher, and you do not
have one of the required type
(or a Science Voucher), you may pay any 3 other
Vouchers instead to gain 1 Science Voucher which
you then pay as the required Voucher.
:



### CHEMICALS EXCHANGE

?
Whenever you need to pay a
Chemical, and you do not have
one of the required type, you
may pay any 2 Vouchers to exchange one of your
Chemicals with one of the required type from the
Supply. The returned Chemical is placed on the
rightmost matching empty slot of the Supply. Then,
take the leftmost Chemical of the required type
from the Supply, and immediately use it for the
originally intended action (you do not need space in
your Workshop for this Chemical).
:




##### MACHINE PARTS EXCHANGE


Whenever you need to pay a
Machine Part, and you do not
?
1
:
have one of the required type,
you may pay any 2 Vouchers to exchange one of
your Machine Parts with another Machine Part
from the reserve.




# POST-SETUP SUPPLY ROUND

After setup is complete, but before the game begins,
in turn order, each player takes a turn during which
they perform any number of the actions in the Supply
Location (paying the cost as usual). These actions are
described on page 13.



After all players have performed
their actions, if any player
performed the Take the Initiative
action, the turn order is adjusted
at the end of the Post-Setup
Supply Round (see page 13).


# ? PHASE A: PLAYER TURNS

In this Phase, each player in turn order
takes a turn. On your turn, perform the following
steps in order:

1\. Use 1 Subsidy tile OR 1 Investment tile.

2\. Move your Scientist.

3\. Perform actions.

4\. Place Research tokens.


Also, at any time during
your turn, if you have any
Award tokens on the space
to the top-left of your
Office, you may place
them on any empty spaces
of your Office, gaining
the benefit depicted on
the spaces, if any.


# I. USE A SUBSIDY TILE


# OR INVESTMENT TILE m

Start your day with the advantage of a Government subsidy or an investment in your work.

If you have any Subsidy tiles that are blue-side up to
the left of your Laboratory, you may flip one of them
over to gain the benefit printed on it. These benefits
are all described on page 8 of the Player Aid.

Note: Subsidy tiles are single-use only; once
flipped, they cannot be flipped back over.

You never pay Vouchers when using a Subsidy tile,
even if the tile allows you to perform an action that
would normally cost you Vouchers.

Alternatively, if you have
any Investment tiles to the
left of your Laboratory, you
may return one of them to
the reserve to do one of the
following:

1\. Setting a Goal:

Move one of your Goal tiles
from below your Laboratory
onto an empty Goal space of
your Laboratory matching
the color of the tile. Gain the
benefit depicted on that space.


On the top spaces choose
only 1 of the 2 depicted
benefits.

2\. Receive funding:
Flip one of the face up
Goal tiles already on
your Laboratory and
gain the benefits from
the corresponding
Funding track (see
page 10).

Note: Each Goal tile on one of your Goal spaces
is an objective that will be scored at the end of the
game if you meet the conditions depicted on the tile.

The reverse side of a Goal tile has a black
background. This indicates it has already been
flipped over, it is still scored at the end of the game.

Note: You can have more than 6 Subsidy /
Investment tiles next to your Laboratory. Just place
any excess nearby.


# FUNDING TRACKS

For each Location, the work done by you and your Bots increases your recognition, thereby gaining more external sponsorship and funding for your research.
The more you do, the more funding you get.


Whenever you receive funding (by flipping
over one of your Goal tiles), you gain the
benefits of the track corresponding to the
color of the tile flipped (blue = Government,
green = Lab, purple = R&D).

The position of your Funding marker on each
track will determine how many CP you get at
the end of the game from that track.


## GOVERNMENT FUNDING TRACK


The Government Funding track offers grants in
the form of resources.

Gain the benefits
depicted below
the space your
marker is on and
every space to the
left of it.



## LAB FUNDING TRACK


The Lab Funding track offers Science Vouchers and
access to one of the other Funding tracks.


First, gain the Science Vouchers depicted below the
space your marker is on and every space to the left of
it. Then, choose one of the other two tracks and gain
the benefits of that track, treating your marker as if it
were a number of spaces further ahead on the track,
as depicted by the modifier shown below the position
of your marker on the Lab Funding track (do not
move the marker).


## R&D FUNDING TRACK


Gain one benefit
depicted below
the space your
marker is on OR
any space to the
left of it.
