# SPEAKEASY A GAME BY VITAL LACERDA

"Speakeasy" will transport you back to the roaring 1920s, during the era of Prohibition.

In the Prohibition Era, Manhattan was under the firm control
of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his
grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system,
called the Commission. He divided Manhattan into different
districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for
handling their "legitimate operations".

These mobsters operated under a non-aggression pact, refraining
from attacking each other and cooperating when needed. This
agreement ensured a relatively peaceful coexistence, allowing
them to focus on expanding their operations without internal
conflicts.

The mobsters heavily guarded their controlled areas to maintain
order and prevent newcomers from encroaching on their
territories. Any unauthorized attempt to establish a presence

was met with hostility. As a result, only those within the
existing network could participate in the lucrative world of
illegal activities.

Their thriving empire and illicit activities, such as bootlegging
and gambling, brought them substantial profits. Lucky Luciano
ensured that each mobster received a share of the overall
revenue based on their performance and the efficiency of their
operations. The success of their empire relied on effective
organization, cooperation, and loyalty to the system established
by Lucky Luciano.

Despite the criminal nature of their activities, they were
skilled entrepreneurs who managed their criminal empires
with strategic precision, making them formidable forces in
Manhattan's underground during the Prohibition Era.

# WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE GAME?

In Speakeasy, you will take on the role of a savvy mobster
Boss, managing and operating your speakeasy businesses
in Manhattan during this exciting and dangerous time.

But running a Speakeasy empire is no easy task, and you'll
need to use all your cunning and resources to stay ahead
of the competition. As you improve your operations,
become more infamous, and upgrade to more lavish
Nightclubs and even Casinos, you'll attract the attention
of the outside mafia and the cops. You must use your
leverage to keep your business running and receive your
share from Lucky Luciano.

You can associate with outside mobsters and even attack

and rob Rum-runners to gain valuable resources and an
edge over your rivals.

You'll need to manage your cards carefully, placing your
Capos strategically to deliver illicit liquor. You'll need
to hire goons to help you take over Manhattan. You will
cook your books to fill up your safes with tax-free money
by achieving goals.

The ultimate goal is simple: accumulate the most money
and become the most successful mobster in the city. Do
you have what it takes to rise to the top of the speakeasy
scene and take over Manhattan during Prohibition?
It's time to grab your fedora and find out in Speakeasy.


# WINNING CONDITION

The winner is the player who accumulates the most
money during the game.

Speakeasy is a worker placement, card management, and
area control game driven by goals.

Players gain and spend money during the game for various
notable tasks: Bootlegging to gain money by selling
liquor, "cooking the books" to collect money based on
goals, opening buildings or taking over other Mobster
Speakeasies, upgrading Speakeasies into Nightclubs
or Casinos, attacking and robbing Rum-runners, and
controlling districts.

FAMILY MEMBERS


<figure>
</figure>


Family Members are your trusty soldiers.
They assist in protecting your buildings
in Manhattan, allowing you to run your
businesses. They also have the role of
attacking Ships at the Docks. You can
gain them through various actions,
benefits on your Operations board, Infamy track, Helper
cards, and City tiles.

ambush to attack a
Rum-runner Ship.


## OPERATING BUILDINGS

A building is Operating if either (or both) of the
following is true:

•


<figure>
</figure>


There is no Cop in
the same district as
the building.

•

The building is
protected by a
Family Member.


<figure>
</figure>


## ASSOCIATED MOBSTERS

Associating with a Mobster allows you to
use them to increase your Attack strength
when taking over other Mobsters'
Speakeasies as well as increasing your defense strength
when defending your buildings during a Mob War. You
must pay your Associate's fee each time you use them.


<figure>

20

</figure>


GOLDEN RULE:
A NON-OPERATING BUILDING
IS THE SAME AS A NON-EXISTENT BUILDING.

If the building is not Operating, it cannot receive,
produce, distribute, or sell barrels. It does not count
for the Payout Zone Control (pg. 10), nor to the Final
Scoring round (pg. 20).


<figure>
</figure>


In the game, only the Crate tiles and
Central Park Goal tiles with this
symbol break the GOLDEN
RULE: you may achieve the goal
without having the building
Operating.


<figure>
</figure>


## ATTACKING AND DEFENDING

Mobsters may attack players' buildings
during a Mob War, and players may attack
Mobsters' Speakeasies and Rum-runner
E
il
Ships while performing their actions. In
all cases, for an attack to be successful, the
Attack strength must exceed the defense strength.


## Example:

Green is on the offensive, targeting a Mobster-
controlled Speakeasy. The Mobster's strength stands at 5.
For Green's attack to prevail, she must gather an Attack
strength of at least 6.

In another scenario, a Mobster sets their sights on
Purple's Casino. The Mobster's Attack strength registers
at 7. Purple only needs a defense strength of 7 to fend
off the Mobster's assault.


<figure>
</figure>


## GOONS

Goons help you while attacking or
defending. Each Goon you return to the
supply temporarily increases your attack or
defense strength by 1. The cost of hiring
a Goon is shown on its space on your
Operations board. When returning a Goon to the supply,
you must always return the highest cost Goon.

# LAUNDERING MONEY

Money in front of you ("cash in your
pocket") and money behind your Safe
screen ("in your safe") may be spent
at any time, but the money in your
safe must be "laundered" at a 2-to-1 ratio to do so. For
example, using your safe money to spend $1 requires you
to actually spend $2 from your safe.


<figure>
</figure>


BLOCKED DISTRICTS
(2-PLAYER GAME ONLY)

A district containing a
Blocked District marker
may not be built in. Any
port in the district may still be used, Trucks may still enter
and leave the district as normal, and a Cop may still be
placed in the district.

# GAMEPLAY

Prohibition lasted 13 years, from 1920 to 1933. The total rounds you play in the game equals the number of years the prohibition law lasted. This includes the Setup Round,
11 player rounds, and the Final Scoring Round.

The game is divided into 4 ACTS, each made up of phases.

Phase 2 of each ACT consists of a number of player
rounds and is where you will spend most of your time
playing the game. During this phase, players send their
Capos to "talk" with Persons of Interest, and then perform
the actions at that Location. There are four player rounds
in ACT 1, three each in ACTS 2 and 3, and just one in
ACT 4, totaling 11 player rounds.

At the end of ACTS 1 to 3 there is a Lucky Luciano
Phase. At the end of ACT 4 there is a Final Scoring
round.

## ACT STRUCTURE

Perform the following phases for each ACT:

1\. RETURN CAPOS (ACTS 2/3/4)

2\. PLAYER ROUNDS (4/3/3/1 rounds
in ACTS 1/2/3/4)


## 3. LUCKY LUCIANO PHASE (ACTS 1/2/3)

3.3. Payout Zone Control

4\. FINAL SCORING ROUND (Only in ACT 4)

## 1. RETURN CAPOS (ACTS 2/3/4)


<figure>
</figure>


"Capo" is an Italian word that means
"head" and was often used to refer to
high-ranking members of Italian-
American organized crime groups like the
Mafia. These individuals were responsible
for overseeing various criminal activities,
including bootlegging and illegal alcohol
distribution, during Prohibition.

At the start of ACT 1 each player has 4 Capos to play.

At the start of ACT 2 (1925), return 3 of your Capos from
the main board to your Operations board, and send the
remaining 1 to the game box.

At the start of ACT 3 (1928), return your
3 Capos from the main board to your
Operations board.

At the start of ACT 4 (1931), return only 1
of your Capos from the main board to your
Operations board and send the remaining 2
to the game box.

On each ACT you keep playing until no more
Capos are left in your Operations board.

which players take
turns is determined
O
by the order of their Turn Order markers on the upper
D
row of the Turn Order track, starting with the marker
on the leftmost space and proceeding to the right.

On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1\.

# Example:

In the previous turn, Blue altered his turn order from
the 4th position to the 2nd position by moving his token
to the lower row. Purple, initially in the 1st position,
shifted her turn order to the 3rd position.

At the round's conclusion (after each player has taken
a turn and placed a Capo), the turn order for the next
round is adjusted.

Players with their tokens on the upper row must adapt
their positions to accommodate the selected positions of
players on the lower row. In the given scenario, Green
shifts to the right to yield his position to Purple, and
Yellow to the left to give her position to Blue.

In the subsequent round, the play order will be: Yellow,
Blue, Purple, Green.

## 3. LUCKY LUCIANO PHASE (ACTS 1/2/3)

Luciano was instrumental in creating a powerful criminal organization known as the Commission. The Commission was a coalition of top mob bosses from different crime
families that controlled various territories across the United States. Manhattan was just one of these territories.

As a reward for their efforts and loyalty, the crime families received a share of the profits generated by their respective territories. Their income was determined based on their
success in running their criminal enterprises, making the Prohibition Era a time of immense wealth and power for organized crime in Manhattan.

In this phase, more Mobsters and Cops will enter
Manhattan, and players will receive money based on how
much control they have in each of the 3 Zones.


### 3.1. MOB WAR


<figure>
</figure>


Under the Commission guidelines to
maintain order and prevent newcomers
from encroaching their controlled areas,
any unauthorized attempt to establish a
presence was met with hostility.

Without looking, shuffle the stack of Mobster tiles for this
ACT, indicated by the letter on the top left corner of the
tile (B in ACT 1, C in ACT 2, D in ACT 3).

Repeat the following steps a number of times equal to the
number of face down Mobster District tiles in districts
on the Main board (3/3/4 for ACTS 1/2/3. In a 2-player
game 2/2/3).

a. Starting with the lowest numbered of these districts,
place the topmost Mobster tile of the shuffled stack,
City face up, on the related district of the Mobster
board.

back in the game box.


<figure>

</figure>


Place a Mobster
Speakeasy next to each
empty building space in
the district (if any).


### MOB WAR STRENGTH OF A MOBSTER

Each district with a Mobster district tile will suffer an
attack on every player building in that district. The
Mob War strength of a Mobster is equal to the sum of
its strength (shown in the brown box) plus its strength
modifier (shown below in the red box).


### Example:

6

The Mob War strength of Birdie Brown is 7
(strength 6 plus the strength modifier +1).

25 +1


#### d. DEFENDING A MOBSTER ATTACK

If there are any player buildings in that district, in turn
order, each player must decide if they want to defend or
not, each of their buildings in that district.

To defend a building, you must equal or exceed the Mob
War strength of the Mobster with your Building defense
strength (see next column).


<figure>
</figure>


Each of your buildings you
1
are able to defend remains
on the board. Each of your
buildings you do not
successfully defend are
removed from the game
along with any Family
Member protecting it. Return any barrels next to the
removed building, (in the case of the Stills, on your
Operations board) back to the supply. Then a Mobster
Speakeasy is placed on that building space.


<figure>
</figure>


If the Mobster does not place any
Speakeasies in the attacked district (because
there were no empty building spaces and all
player buildings were defended), remove
the Mobster tile from the game, and flip
the Mobster Strength tile in the district face down.
Mobsters on the board from previous ACTS stay in play,
even if all their Speakeasies are lost.

Once there are no more Mobster District tiles remaining
for this ACT, place any remaining Mobster tiles for this
ACT back in the game box.

9

#### BUILDING DEFENSE STRENGTH

Your Building defense strength is equal to the sum of
your strength
9
indicated on the yellow track on your
Operations board, plus any modifiers you add:

. You may return any number of your Goons to the
supply to add 1 for each returned this way.

· If you have an Associate Mobster, you may choose to
pay them to add that Mobster's strength. To do so, pay
the amount shown on the left of the Mobster tile on
your Operations board.

These modifiers only apply to the defense strength of
the building you are currently defending, not all of your
buildings in that district.


#### PREPARE THE NEXT MOB WAR

If you are on ACT 1, flip the stack of 3 Mobster District
tiles on the Main board and place them face down on the
related districts on top of the strength spaces (gun). If you
are on ACT 2, flip the remaining 4 Mobster District tiles
and do the same. (2/3 in a 2-Player game).

Prohibition officers, in collaboration with
local law enforcement, raided warehouses

Lucky Luciano ensured that each Mobster received
a fair share of the overall revenue based on their
performance and the efficiency of their operations.


<figure>

L
S

D

b

</figure>


Ensure all Zone Control markers
(Mobsters' and Players') are on the
bottommost space of their respective
Zone Control tracks.

In order of district number, check who controls each
district:

· The player with the best building (see hierarchy
diagram on the next page) with a Family Member
next to it, controls the district. If there is a tie for the
best building with a Family Member next to it, all
tied players control the district.

. Otherwise, if there is neither a Cop in the district, nor
a Family Member, the player with the best building in
the district controls the district. If there is a tie for the
best building, all tied players control the district.

The number of buildings a player has does not matter,
only each player's best Operating building (see page 7 on
Operating buildings and Golden Rule).

Each player who controls the district moves their Zone
Control marker up one space on the Zone Control track
for the Zone the district is in.

· Otherwise, if no player has an Operating building
in the district and there are one or more Mobster
Speakeasies in the district, the district is Mobster-
controlled (Cops don't affect the Mobsters'
Speakeasies): move the Mobster Zone Control marker
up one space on the Zone Control track for the Zone
the district is in.

. Otherwise the district is not controlled by anyone.


<figure>

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->

</figure>


<!-- PageBreak -->


#### Example 1 :

There is only district 12 left to finish the Zone Control
check in Midtown. A Cop has entered district 12.
There is a Mobster Speakeasy, and a Yellow Casino, but
because it does not have a Family Member protecting
it against the Cop, the Mobster controls the district.
Advance the Mobster's marker one space up on the Zone
Control track.


<figure>

S

</figure>


#### Example 2:

After checking Downtown and Midtown, it's time to
check who controls Uptown.

Starting with the lowest district number, district 13,
there is no Cop in it. Yellow has a Speakeasy and Green
has a Nightclub, so Green controls the district.


<figure>

13

</figure>


Green advances his marker one space up on the Zone
Control track.

In district 14, Yellow has a Nightclub and a Speakeasy
and Blue has a Nightclub. All buildings are operating.
Both Yellow and Blue are in control of the district. The
number of buildings does not matter, only each player's
best Operating building. Both players increase their
marker one step up the on Zone Control track.


<figure>

2

</figure>


#### Example 3 :

District 15 has no Cop, there are 2 Mobster Speakeasies
and the Purple Stills. Purple controls the district, and
advances her marker one space up on the Zone Control
track.


<figure>
</figure>


District 16 has a Cop, and a Mobster Speakeasy. Blue
has a Speakeasy protected by a Family Member, and
Green has a Casino which is not protected. Blue controls
the district because the Green Casino is not operating.
Blue advances their marker one space up on the
Uptown Zone Control track.


<figure>
</figure>


#### DISTRICT CONTROL HIERARCHY

Family Member Present > Operating Casino >
Operating Nightclub > Operating Speakeasy >
Operating Stills > Mobster Speakeasy.


##### Notes:

. The number of buildings in the
district does not matter.

. The Family Member always win. In
a tie, follow the building Hierarchy.

· Mobster Speakeasies are not
affected by Cops.

· Remember the GOLDEN RULE:
A NON-OPERATING BUILDING IS THE
SAME AS A NON-EXISTENT BUILDING
(PAGE 7).

#### LUCKY LUCIANO PAYOUT

For each Zone, receive money from
the supply to your safe based on your
position on its Zone Control track,
according to the Lucky Luciano payout
chart next to the track. The player with the highest Zone
Control marker on the track receives the 1st place payout,
the player with the second highest marker receives the
2nd place payout, and so forth.

Include the Mobster Zone Control marker when
determining your position. In case of a tie, tied players
receive the lowest payout value among the tied positions.
If you do not control any district, you are ineligible for
the payout.

e

9
Designer Note: The simplest method to determine
your payout position is by counting the number of
Zone Control markers positioned above and within
the same space as yours on the track, including both
the Mobster's and your own markers. This total
indicates your payout position.

##### Example 1 :


<figure>

After assessing
Midtown,
Mobsters and
Green are tied for
25
controlling the
15
most districts,

resulting in a

(with 2 markers
occupying the top
position). Yellow
and Purple are tied for the second most, thus each
receiving a payout of $5 (with 4 markers positioned
above and in the same place, indicating the 4th
position).

The following are common actions and effects, performed
when you send a Capo for a "talk" at a location, play an
Operations card, or at various other times in the game.


<figure>
</figure>


## PLAY ONE OPERATIONS CARD

Play an Operations card from your hand
to the designated area of your Operations
board, depending on the card's type. The
symbol to the left indicates you may play an
Operations card of any type.

1\. If there is already an Operations card in that area,
discard it, face up, to the bottom of the appropriate
Operations deck.

2\. Place the card you are playing in the designated area.
If you are playing a Stills Operations card and there are
barrels in your Stills area, move them to the new card.

3\. Gain the benefit indicated in the top left corner of the
card you are playing (above the dashed line).

4\. Perform the action of the card you are playing:

a. VIP Room Card: Get Protection (page 17).

b. Party Card: Sell barrels from buildings (page 13).

c. Stills Card: Produce barrels (page 13).

d. Fleet Card: Pick up and deliver barrels (page 16).

## INCREASE AN OPERATIONS LEVEL


<figure>
</figure>


When you increase an Operations level by 1, move the
appropriate Operations marker one space to the right.
You may only increase an Operations level to level 5 if
you discard an Operations card (of any type). You may
not increase an Operations level beyond level 5. Each
time you increase an Operations level, also increase your
Infamy by the same amount.


<figure>
</figure>


## INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH LEVEL

When you increase your Strength level
by 1, move your Strength marker one
space to the right. You may only increase
your Strength level to 4 if you also discard any Oper-
ations card. You may only increase your Strength level
to 5 if you also discard any two Operations cards. You
may not increase your Strength level beyond 5.


<figure>

U

</figure>


Each time you increase your Strength level, also increase
your Infamy by the same amount.


<figure>
</figure>


## INCREASING YOUR INFAMY

Each time you increase the level of one of
your operations or strength, immediately
advance your Infamy marker on the
Infamy track by the same amount. The position of your
Infamy marker is always equal to the sum of all of your
Operations levels plus your strength and so may be
checked at any time.

The position of your Infamy marker on the Infamy
track indicates the amount you may sell your barrels for.
Additionally, upon reaching certain spaces, you gain the
benefit shown (a Family Member, Helper card, Operations
card, or new spaces to place Cooked Books).

Q

</figure>


## DISCARD ANY OPERATIONS CARD TO INCREASE AN OPERATIONS LEVEL ONCE MORE


<figure>
</figure>


You may discard any one Operations card to increase the
indicated Operations level by 1. The type of Operations
card does not need to match the type of Operations Level
being increased. If this increase brings your Operations
level to 5 (or 4 and 5 for Strength level), you still must
discard the necessary additional Operations card.


### Example:

Purple played a Fleet card, utilizing the benefit
specified at the top of the card. Consequently, she
increases her Fleet Operations Level by one space. Now,
she opts to discard another card, further advancing the
same Operations Level to the 4th space, thus amplifying
her Fleet range from 3 to 4.

## SELL BARRELS

Sell a number of barrels that are next to your
Operating buildings up to the limit indicated
below your Party Operations marker.

The amount you sell each barrel for depends on the
position of your Infamy marker, and the type of building
you are selling the barrel at:

</figure>


Locate the barrel space highest up the Infamy track that
your marker is on or has passed.

If you are selling at a Speakeasy, use the lower of the
two amounts shown on that space. If you are selling at a
Nightclub or Casino, use the higher of the two amounts
shown. You cannot sell barrels to Stills.

Return the sold barrels to the supply. The money goes to
your hand (cash).


### Example:

Blue is able to sell 2
barrels. His Infamy
marker has reached
space 12 on the
Infamy track, he will
earn $15 for the
H
barrel from his
Operating Speakeasy
and $20 for the
barrel sold from his Operating Nightclub.

# LOCATIONS

Each location has between 1 and 3 Persons of Interest.


<figure>
</figure>


A Capo may only be sent to "talk" with an available
person, with the exception of the Restaurant; there is
no limit to the number of Capos that may be sent there.
You can send your Capos to different persons in the same
location.


# PERSON OF INTEREST

Each Person of Interest will allow you to perform several
actions when your Capo is sent to talk to them.

Actions shown in a box are associated with the location,
and are performed when a Capo is sent to talk to any
person at that location. Other actions are specific to a
person and are performed only when a Capo is sent to
talk to a person in the same column as that action.

The actions of the chosen person must be resolved from
top to bottom. The order they are resolved in each row
does not matter.

All actions are optional with one exception: discarding
an Operations card and changing turn order at the
Restaurant.

OPEN A SPEAKEASY OR
STILLS OR TAKE OVER A
MOBSTER SPEAKEASY

Up to 2 times, perform either of the following actions (the
same action twice, or 2 different actions).

For each action you perform, you must first pay the cost
of the chosen Speakeasy ($3, $5, or $8) or Stills ($5) that
you are placing as indicated on your Operations board.


<figure>
</figure>


## A: OPEN A SPEAKEASY OR STILLS

1\. Place your chosen Speakeasy or Stills onto an empty
building space in any district of Manhattan.

2\. Move the City tile (if any) on the building space to
your Operations board.

3\. Gain the benefit of the building indicated below its
space on your Operations board (see player aid).


<figure>

e
Note: You may open a Speakeasy or Stills in
a district containing a Cop, but it will not
be operating until you protect it with a
Family Member.

c

</figure>


## Example 1 :


<figure>
</figure>


Blue decides to open
the Stills on a space
with no Mobsters.
He pays $5, moves
the building to the
map and gets the
City tile from the
chosen space.
Finally, he gets the
benefit of opening
the Stills.


## B: TAKE OVER A MOBSTER SPEAKEASY

In order to take over a Mobster Speakeasy, you must attack
it with greater strength. Your Attack strength is equal to
the sum of your strength plus any modifiers you add:

. For each Goon you return to the supply, add 1
strength.

· If you are associated with a Mobster, you may choose
to pay them to add that Mobster's strength to your
own. To do so, pay the amount shown on the left of
the Mobster tile on your Operations board.


<figure>
</figure>


P

Note: You may not take over a Mobster
Speakeasy in the district of your Associate
Mobster (if any). This is tracked by your
Associate marker.

The defense strength of the Mobster Speakeasy is equal to
the Mobster Strength tile in the district.

To take over the Mobster Speakeasy, your Attack strength
must exceed the Mobster's defense strength. If you cannot
exceed its defense strength, you may not take over that
Mobster Speakeasy.

1\. Place your Speakeasy or Stills on the building space.
Return the Mobster Speakeasy to the supply.

2\. Move the City tile (if any) on the building space to
your Operations board.

3\. Gain the benefit indicated below the space your
building came from on your Operations board.


<figure>

</figure>


At the end of your
turn, if you have
more than four City
tiles on your
Operations board,
choose which to
keep, placing each
one you do not

want face up on any space (with or without a tile) of the
middle column of the City tile display. They are now
available to draw.


### Example 2:

Blue decides to open a Speakeasy in district 4. All
spaces are occupied by Mobster Speakeasies so he needs
to take one over. The Mobster's defense strength in the
district is 6, as shown on the Mobster Strength tile.
He needs at least 7 Attack strength to take over. His
strength is 2, and he has 1 Goon. He discards his Goon
and hires his Associate for $5, giving him an Attack
strength of 7 (2+1+4). The take over is successful, and
the Mobster's Speakeasy is removed from the game. Then
Blue follows the normal procedure to open a Speakeasy.

### OPEN A NIGHTCLUB OR CASINO, UPGRADE ONE OF YOUR SPEAKEASIES TO A NIGHTCLUB OR A CASINO, OR TAKE OVER A MOBSTER SPEAKEASY

Up to 2 times, perform either of the following actions (the
same action twice, or 2 different actions).

For each action you perform, you must first pay the cost
of the Nightclub ($12) or Casino ($17 and discard an
Operations card from your hand).


<figure>
</figure>


## A: OPEN A NIGHTCLUB OR CASINO

1\. Choose an empty building space in a Zone
(Downtown, Midtown, or Uptown) where you do not
already have a building of the type you are opening.
Place your Nightclub or Casino onto that building
space.

2\. Move the City tile (if any) on the building space to

### PLAY ONE PARTY CARD

Play one Party card from your hand to the
Party area of your Operations board. See
"Play an Operations card" on page 12.


#### Example:

On her first action, Purple opts to take over a
Speakeasy in district 5. The Mobster's defense strength
in the district is 5. To succeed, Purple requires at
least 6 Attack strength. Currently, her strength is at
4, and she has 2 Goons. Despite the option to enlist
her Associate, Purple chooses to utilize her 2 Goons,
providing her with a total Attack strength of 6,
enough for the take over. She replaces the Mobster's
Speakeasy with her Casino, paying the cost of $17 plus
1 Operations card. However, she finds herself short on
funds, with only $10 in her pocket. Consequently, she
withdraws $14 from her safe to cover the remaining cost
of the Casino. Finally, she transfers the City tile to her
board. The Casino does not yield immediate benefits.

On her second action, Purple intends to upgrade her
Speakeasy to a Nightclub in Uptown. However, she
realizes that she already has a Nightclub in district 16,
which is in the same Zone. Thus, she shifts her focus to
upgrading her Speakeasy in district 7 of Midtown.
Having already constructed the second group of
Speakeasies, she is entitled to a $5 discount for
upgrading her Speakeasy into a Nightclub. Despite the
discounted cost of $7, she needs to withdraw $14 from
her safe to cover the expense. Subsequently, she removes
the Speakeasy from the gameboard and replaces it with
one of her Nightclubs, gaining the benefit underneath it.

PLAY ONE FLEET CARD AND
GAIN A +2 RANGE BONUS

+2
Play one Fleet card from your
hand to the Fleet area of your
Operations board. See "Play
an Operations card" on page 12. This action gives you a
+2 bonus to each Truck's range during the Fleet card's Pick
Up and Deliver barrels action.


<figure>
</figure>


##### PICK UP AND DELIVER BARRELS

Your Trucks are used to pick up and
deliver barrels to your Operating
buildings, so you can sell them.
You can pick up barrels from your
Operating Stills or buy them from Rum-runner Ships at
ports. Each Truck may hold up to two barrels and may
only deliver to an Operating building without a barrel
next to it. You cannot deliver to Stills.


## TO MOVE YOUR TRUCKS:

. You start the game with one truck available. As soon
as your Fleet Operations marker is on or to the right
of level 3, your second Truck becomes available for
use, (the one below your Operations track).

. Each Truck may enter the map in any district of
Manhattan without spending any movement. Once a
Truck has been placed on the Main board, it may not
leave the map.

. Each Truck has an amount of movement equal to
their range. If you have both Trucks, it is recommend
to fully move one Truck before moving your other
Truck.

The range of each Truck is equal to your Fleet Operations
level plus any bonuses you may have:

. +2 range, if you play the Fleet Operations card on
your Operations board that gives you that benefit.

· +2 range if you are "talking" with the leftmost Person.

Each Truck spends 1 movement to move into any
adjacent district (not diagonally, nor through Central
Park, meaning that districts 13 and 15 are not connected
with districts 14 and 16).

In a 2-player game, Trucks may move into and out of
blocked districts as normal.

Continue moving your Trucks until all movement for each
Truck has been used, or you no longer wish to move them.


## TO PICK UP BARRELS:

. This can be done during your trucks movement.

. If your Truck is in the district containing your
Operating Stills, you may fill it with barrels from your
Stills on your Operations board.

. If your Truck is in a district containing a Rum-runner
Ship, you may buy barrels from the Ship to fill your
Truck. To buy one barrel, pay the amount shown below
the rightmost barrel on the corresponding Rum-runner
Ship on the City Docks board and place it onto your
Truck. If there are no barrels on the Ship, pay the
amount shown below the leftmost empty barrel space
and load the Truck with a barrel from the supply.

. After buying barrels from a Rum-runner Ship, move
the Ship clockwise to the next port without a Rum-
runner Ship.


<figure>

1

</figure>


## TO DELIVER BARRELS:

. This can be done during your trucks movement.

. If your Truck is in a district containing one of your
Operating buildings without a barrel next to it, you
may take a barrel from your Truck and place it next
to the building. A building may never have more than
one barrel next to it. Trucks may finish their movement
with barrels on them. You cannot deliver to Stills.


### Example 1 :

Yellow's Truck is in district 16. Sandra "Bluie"
Daisy's Ship is in the port. Yellow buys 2 barrels, the
first one for $5 and a second one for $6. Sandra's Ship
moves to the next empty port in district 6.

As her Truck is already in a district with one of her
Operating Casinos, she delivers one barrel to it without
spending any movement. However, Yellow is not
able to deliver a barrel to her Nightclub as it is not
operating (a Cop is in the district and the building is
not protected).

With a range of 4 (2 from her Fleet Operations level
and 2 from the Fleet Operations card on her Operations
board), she spends 3 movement to move her Truck
to district 10 and deliver a barrel to her Operating
Speakeasy. She skips her last movement.


<figure>
</figure>


#### Example 2 :

Each of Purple's Trucks has a range of 5: 3 from her
Operations level and 2 from the Garage action space.

One Truck is in the same district as her Stills (district
8) and she moves her second Truck from her Operations
board, to the same district.


<figure>

</figure>


She has 4 barrels in
her Stills (1), loads 2
barrels onto each of
her Trucks, then moves
one Truck to district 4
and places a barrel
next to her empty
Speakeasy and another
barrel next to her
empty Casino (2).

For a second movement, she moves the Truck to district
7 and buys 2 barrels from Arnold Rothstein's Ship (3),
which then immediately moves to the next empty port.

Now Purple moves her Truck to district 9 to deliver a
barrel to her empty Speakeasy (4), and then to district 5
to deliver the second barrel to her empty Nightclub (5).


<figure>

7

6

</figure>


Now, she spends 4
movement to move her
second Truck to
district 15 and
delivers a barrel to
each of her empty
Speakeasies (6).

Purple then spends her remaining 1 movement
returning to district 13, and buys 2 more barrels from
Arnold Rothstein's Ship (7), that just moved there
from the previous purchase.

. Each Family Member you send costs an amount of
Leverage according to your position on the Turn
Order track (4 if you are in a space of the leftmost
column, 3 in a space of the next column, and so on).

. You have an amount of Leverage to spend equal to
the total of the values in the top right corner of each
Operations card on your Operations board. You may
also discard one or more of your Leverage tokens to
increase this total (each Leverage token you discard
adds 1 Leverage. The cards are not discarded).

you. The tile shows an ongoing benefit you
have for the rest of the game (see page 22).

Take the top Crate tile from the Crate tiles stack and place
it face up on the Crate space from the Ship you attacked,
replacing the tile you took.


<figure>
</figure>


Take the rightmost barrel from the Ship you
attacked and place it next to one of your
Operating buildings anywhere in Manhattan
that does not already have a barrel next to it,
or on your Stills area if you have an Operating Stills. If
you do not have either an Operating building without a
barrel next to it, or an Operating Stills, return the barrel
to the supply.

If there are no barrels on the Ship, instead take a barrel
from the supply.


<figure>
</figure>


Take one of your Family
Members from the Docks
Zone matching the Zone of
the Rum-runner Ship you
attacked and place it on any empty space in your VIP
area. If this would exceed the limit shown by your VIP
Room Operations, return the Family Member to your
supply instead (they just got shot and fell into the river).


<figure>
</figure>


Move the attacked Rum-runner Ship
clockwise to the next empty port
without a Rum-runner Ship.

Example:

Blue has one Family Member in the Downtown Docks
Zone, while Purple has two.

Stephanie St. Clair's Rum-runner Ship is in a port in
Downtown.


<figure>
</figure>


Blue has strength of
4, giving him an
Attack strength of 12
if he gets help from
the 2 Purple Family
Members during the
Rum-runner attack.
Blue has 2 Goons
that he may also use
to increase his Attack
strength by up to +2.

Stephanie St. Clair's Ship has had 2 barrels removed,
meaning its Ship's defense strength is 12.

In order to successfully attack this Rum-runner Ship,
Blue must use both of Purple's Family Members and 1
of his Goons to increase his Attack strength to 13.

track, Blue receives $15 to his hand. The Crate tile is
placed face down next to his Operations board, giving

Both of Purple's Family Members were utilized to aid
in the attack, earning him $2 as cash from Blue.

Subsequently, Blue relocates his Family Member from
the Docks to his Operations board. However, since
his VIP area has reached its capacity and there is no
space for the Family Member, he is sent to the supply.
"Rumors circulate that he met a tragic demise, drowned
into the Hudson river."

RESTAURANT


## (NO LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF CAPOS THAT CAN BE SENT)

In the heart of the city, the boss's restaurant becomes the epicenter of intrigue, where clandestine deals are struck, and rivalries simmer beneath the surface. Where all the
books are cooked and skim from gambling is received.


### CHANGE THE TURN ORDER FOR NEXT ROUND

You MUST perform this action when you send a Capo
to the Restaurant. Consequently, if you do not have an
Operations card to discard, you may not send your Capo
to this location.

If you choose the 3rd or 4th space (or 2nd in a 2-player
game), discard another Operations card from your hand.
If you do not have an Operations card to discard, you may
not choose that space.

If you do not have an Operations card to discard and the
only remaining spaces require you to discard a card, you
may not send your Capo to the Restaurant.

Note: In a 3-player game the 4th space is not used.

If any Turn Order markers are located on the lower row of
the Turn Order track, turn Order will change at the end
of the current round and Casinos will pay out. See "Turn
Order" on page 8.


## PERFORM 2 DIFFERENT ACTIONS

Perform 2 different actions in any order:

. Play one Operations card.

· Play up to two City tiles.

· Cook up to three Books.


<figure>
</figure>


### A: PLAY ONE OPERATIONS CARD

See "Play an Operations card" on page 12.


<figure>
</figure>


### B: PLAY UP TO TWO CITY TILES

Gain the bonus or perform the action of up
to two City tiles on your Operations board.
At the end of your turn place each one you
played on any space (with or without a tile)
of the middle column of the City tile display. They are
now available to draw.


<figure>
</figure>


<figure>
</figure>


### C: COOK UP TO THREE BOOKS

"Cooking the Books" refers to altering
financial records to evade taxes,
mimicking the mafia's tactics.

Place up to 3 Books from your Operations board onto
Cooked Book spaces on the Main board to get money to
your safe, and in some places, immediate benefits.


#### FOR EACH BOOK:

1\. Choose an empty Cooked Book space in any of the
five Cooked Book areas on the Main board: Docks,
City Hall, Central Park, Infamy track, or Zone Goal
tiles. You must fulfill the requirements of the chosen
space.

2\. Place a Book from your Operations board onto the
chosen space.

3\. Gain the benefit indicated on the space (if any), and
the money indicated next to the space to your safe.

## COOKED BOOK SPACE REQUIREMENTS:

You can have multiple Books in the same area, but you
may not have a Book in both spaces of the same goal. See
page 23 for more explanations of all the goals.


<figure>

15

</figure>


3 Docks goals: You must have at least
the indicated number of Crate tiles.


<figure>
</figure>


3 City Hall goals: There must be the
indicated number of districts containing
one or more of your Family Members
protecting your buildings.


<figure>
</figure>


5 Central Park goals: You must fulfill
the requirements shown on the Central
Park goal tile above the space.


<figure>
</figure>


3 Infamy goals: Your Infamy marker
must be at or above the indicated space
on the Infamy track.


<figure>

20

</figure>


3 Zone goals: You must fulfill the
requirements shown on the Zone Goal
tile to the right of the space.


### Example :

Blue cannot place a Book on this Docks goal because he
may not have a Book in both spaces of the same goal.
But he can place it on the next goal of this type if he
already has 2 or more Crate tiles.

### EXCHANGE CAPOS

Exchange your Capo with
another player's Capo that
is already "talking" with a
person not at the Park.

Send the other player's Capo to "talk" with someone
available in the Park (it does not matter which one). They
gain any one of the indicated bottom benefits: Gain one
Leverage, Gain one City tile, or Gain one Book.

Perform the actions of the person your Capo is now
"talking" with.

## C: GAIN ONE CITY TILE

Take one of the available City tiles from
the display on the Main board and place it
on your Operations board. A City tile is available if it is
face up and not covered by another City tile. If the City
tile you took was from the right column, immediately
take the top City tile from one of the face down City tile
stacks and place it face up in the empty space. The middle
column does not refill.

At the end of your turn, if you have more than four City
tiles on your Operations board, you must place the excess
back on the Main board in the normal way (see page 14).

### Example:

Blue currently has $50 in cash and $220 stored in his safe, totaling $270. He has three Speakeasies, but only scores
for the two that are Operating, resulting in a gain of $20. Furthermore, he owns one Stills ($20), two Nightclubs
($30), and one Casino ($20), all of which are Operating. Additionally, he owns five Helper cards, but only four
different types of bottles, earning him $45. Blue's final score is $405.

### WAYS TO GAIN MONEY

There are two places you gain money to during the game:
your hand (cash) or your safe.

Cash is available to spend at no cost, while money that
is inside the safe must be "laundered" at a 2 to 1 ratio to
do so. Don't be afraid of taking money from the safe if
needed; optimizing your actions is very important.


### CASH

· Bootlegging - Gain money by selling barrels from
your Operating buildings.

. Rum-runner Docks - Gain money from the Crates
(max $24/$25) and later from selling the barrel stolen,
or if your Family Members are used by other players
during the attack.

· Skim from Casinos - At the end of the round in
which any player has changed Turn Order, you gain $3
($5 in a 2-player games) for each of your Operating
Casinos.


## ?


### SAFE MONEY - 2:1 TO WITHDRAW

· Control of Zones - during Lucky Luciano payout.

· Cooking the Books - accomplishing these goals is
one of the best ways to get money in the game.


### WAYS TO SPEND MONEY

· Opening or upgrading buildings.

· Getting help from an Associate.

· Hiring Goons.

· Buying barrels from Rum-runners.

· Hiring Family Members from other players during an
ambush.


### HOW TO INCREASE INFAMY

. By increasing your operations and your Strength level.
Infamy is the sum of all your operations plus your
Strength level.


### PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:

. Ensure that you are prepared to defend your buildings
during the Mob War.

. Take note of the districts where the police will enter
Manhattan before the Lucky Luciano payout.

. Remember that if you have two or more buildings
in the same district during the Mob War, you must
defend each one separately.

. Consider taking over districts with weak Mobsters
instead of opening new Speakeasies in empty spaces,
as the latter will be targeted later in the game.

. Keep in mind that you can gain barrels by buying
them from Rum-runner Ships or from ambushing
them. You do not necessarily need to build the Stills.
Buying from Ships is the fastest way to acquire barrels
to sell, although less profitable.

· As soon as possible, establish Nightclubs and Casinos,
as they yield substantial profits and provide advantages
during the payout step.


### SPEAKEASIES

Hold 1 barrel, sell barrels at lower value - may be
upgraded into a Nightclub or a Casino: Check for
discounts when doing so.

### NIGHTCLUBS

CASINOS

Hold 1 barrel, sell barrels at higher value. Gain $3 ($5 in

GOLDEN RULE:

A NON-OPERATING BUILDING
IS THE SAME AS A NON-EXISTENT BUILDING.

YOU MAY ONLY HAVE 1 NIGHTCLUB
AND 1 CASINO PER ZONE OF MANHATTAN.


<figure>
</figure>


UPGRADING A SPEAKEASY WITH A DISCOUNT:

IF ALL BUILDINGS WITHIN THE SAME GROUP
ARE OFF YOUR OPERATIONS BOARD, WHEN UPGRADING A
SPEAKEASY TO A NIGHTCLUB OR CASINO, YOU ARE ELIGIBLE
FOR A DISCOUNT EQUAL TO THE COST
OF THE RIGHTMOST CLEARED GROUP.

BUT YOU MAY NEVER HAVE A SECOND BOOK
ON THE SAME GOAL.


## VARIANT


<figure>

2

\+

</figure>


### REBUILD YOUR STILLS:

This variant makes the game a bit more forgiving and is recommended for first time players.
If you lose your Stills during a Mob War, you may place it back on your Operations board instead of removing it from the game. This means that you can
rebuild your Stills following the normal rules. You may lose your discount to upgrade a Speakeasy until you rebuild the Stills.

## COOKED BOOK GOALS

There are 5 different types of Book goals that can be achieved during the game. Players cannot have more than 1 Book on each goal. Immediately gain
the benefit, if any, on the space the Book was placed. Cooked Books income goes to your safe. For each tile, the goal described below is the minimum
requirement. You may exceed this requirement and still achieve the goal.

1\. CENTRAL PARK GOALS: During setup, make sure all have different numbers. Gain $10 to your safe and the indicated benefit for each goal achieved. Goals are related to all
the districts of Manhattan. Central Park Goal tiles with this symbol
