# MARS

Following the success of robotic rover missions, the United
Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars
Exploration (DOME). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year
2037. In the decades after the Mars Base Camp was established,
private exploration companies started working towards the
creation of a self-sustaining colony.

As a chief astronaut from one of these enterprises, you want
to be a pioneer in developing the biggest, most advanced colony
on Mars by achieving both DOME mission goals as well as your
company's private agenda.

In the beginning, you are very dependent on supplies from
Earth, and have to travel a lot between the Mars Space Station
and the surface of the planet. As the colony expands over time,
you will construct mines, power generators, water extractors,
greenhouses, oxygen condensers, and shelters. The aim is to
become a self-sufficient colony, independent of any terrestrial
organization. This will require carefully balancing the importance
of water, air, power, and food - the things we need to survive.

Do you dare take part in humankind's biggest challenge?

## GAME OVERVIEW

The game is played over several rounds, each
consisting of two phases: The COLONIZATION
PHASE and the SHUTTLE PHASE.

During the COLONIZATION PHASE, each player
takes a turn, during which they take actions.
The actions a player is able to take depends
on the side of the board they are on. If players
are on the Space Station in orbit, they can take
blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and
take supplies from the warehouse. If players are
at the colony on the surface of the planet, they
can construct buildings with their bots, upgrade
these buildings using blueprints, hire scientists
and take new contracts, welcome new ships, and
explore the planet's surface with their rover.

In the SHUTTLE PHASE, players may travel
between the colony and the space station in orbit.

All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each
other and some are required for the colony to
grow. Building shelters for colonists to live in
requires oxygen, generating oxygen requires
plants, growing plants requires water, extracting
water from ice requires power, generating power
requires mining minerals, and mining minerals
requires colonists.

Upgrading the colony's ability to provide each
of these resources is vital. As the colony grows,
more shelters are needed so that the colonists
can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.

During the game, players are trying to complete
missions. Once a total of three missions have
been completed, the game ends.

To win the game, players must contribute the
most to the development of the first colony on
Mars. This is represented during the game by
players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The
player with the most OP at the end of the game
is declared the winner.


## GAME COMPONENTS


All game components are limited except Resources and Crystals. If you run out of either of them during the game, please use a substitute.


## GAME SETUP

Place the game board in the middle of the table.
The board is divided into two sections. The left
side of the board represents the Mars Space
Station in orbit above Mars [Orbit]. The rest of
the board represents the Colony on the planet's
surface [Colony].


\*
ORBIT SIDE

1\. Shuffle the Discovery tiles and
place them face down in a stack
beside the board. Turn the top 2
tiles face up and place them on
the Exploration space.



2\. Place 3 of each of the following in the
Warehouse spaces, one per space: Crystals,
Batteries, Water, Plants, and Oxygen.

Note: In a 2-player game: Place only 2 of each.

3\. Take the Tech tiles and set
aside those that depict a
Shelter (one in each player
color).



Separate the rest into two
sets based on the color
on the back. Shuffle one set and
place them at random face up on each of
the spaces in the Tech Grid. Shuffle the
8 remaining Tech tiles (not including the
Shelters) and place them face down in two
stacks next to the Tech Grid.

Note: 2-player game: Use only 1 set of tiles.
Remove the 2nd set from the game.


4\. Separate the Blueprint cards into two decks
based on their backs: Level 1 and Level 3,
shuffle each deck separately and place them
face down near the board with the Level 1
cards stacked on top of the Level 3 cards.
Take the top 6 cards from the deck and place
them face up in a display along the side of
the board.


### 4 PLAYER SETUP

The main board
represents a
computer display
where the
colonization of
the planet can
be monitored in
real time from
satellites in orbit.

## COLONY SIDE

5\. Place the Scientist display next to the main
board. Place the 6 Scientist cards in the
spaces on the board in the following order
from left to right: Geologist, R&D Engineer,
Hydrologist, Biochemist, Geochemist, and
Systems Engineer. Place the cards on the top
part of each space, covering the Crystal icon
and leaving the bottom section of each space
(showing the cost) visible. Then place each
Scientist marker on its matching card.

6\. Place the Earth Contract cards face down in
a deck on the Scientist display. There is no
need to shuffle them.

7\. Take the starting Mine (the one with an S on
the back) and place it in the indicated space
in the center of the board.

8\. Take the remaining starting Buildings (with
an S on the back) and place them at random
on the indicated hexes of the board, as per
the setup image. Ensure that the orientation
of the tiles is the same (the notch should be
facing the bottom of the board).

Note: the Shelters will be placed during
player setup.

9\. Place the Building display board near the
Scientist cards. Separate the rest of the
Buildings by type into stacks. Shuffle each
stack separately and place them with the
image of the building face down on the
corresponding spaces.

10\. Take the Research tiles and separate them
by type (color and letter). Place them on the
indicated hexes of the map (keeping all of one
type together in the same corner of the map).

11\. Take the Mission cards and divide them
into two decks based on their type: Short
and Long. Shuffle each deck separately and
choose 2 Short and 1 Long at random (for the
short game) or 1 Short and 2 Long (for the
long game).

Note: for your first game, it is recommended to
use the First Colonists variant (see page 24).
Place the Mission cards face up on the
indicated spaces on the board. For each
Mission, take the Mission marker for that
space and place it near the action relating to
the Mission card.

Mission cards chosen for a Short game. 2 Short and 1 Long.

12\. For each Mission card, place a Mission
tracker cube near the Mission card, on the
appropriate space according to the number
of players in the game.


13\. Place the Remaining Missions marker on
space 3 of the Missions track.

14\. Place all Crystals and Resources next to the
board to make a general supply.


## LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM (LSS)

15\. Place the Colony level marker on the left side
of the second row.

16\. Place the LSS Track markers on the
appropriate spaces of the bottom row.

17\. Shuffle the LSS Reward tiles and
place 4 of them at random face up
on the top spaces. Return the rest
to the box, they will not be needed
for this game.


## PLAYER BOARD

Your Player board represents a display of your main
Shelter, and it is divided into different sections:


A. STORAGE Your Resources will be stored here.
There are five different Resources in the game:
Minerals, Batteries, Water, Plants, and Oxygen. The
number of Resources of each type you can store on
your Player board is equal to the number of Shelter
tiles you have on the map plus one. (e.g. if you have
one Shelter, you can store two of each Resource).
The order in which each Resource appears on
your board is very important. A Resource to the
left of an arrow is needed to build the Building of
the type to the right of the arrow. For example,
you need power (the Battery Resource) to build a
Water Extractor, then you need Water to build a
Greenhouse, and so on.


### B. LABORATORY

5
Here is where you will place
and develop technologies you
research.

### C. LIVING QUARTERS

Your Colonists will go here.
At the beginning of the
game, you have space for 4
Colonists, and 3 of the slots
are occupied. 2 more slots
become available for each
additional Shelter you build.

### D. WORKING AREA

Colonists can be sent here to
boost some of the actions you
take. There is no limit to the
number of Colonists you can
have in your Working Area.


### E. DEPOT

There are 8 spaces in your Depot
for storing Crystals. At the
beginning of the game, however,
you only have 3 slots available as
your Ships are taking 5 of the slots.



### F. HANGAR

Your Private Ships are moved from
your Depot to here during the game.


## PLAYER SETUP

Each player chooses a color and takes the following:

1\. 1 Player board.

2\. 1 Player marker.

3\. 1 OP marker, placed on the 0 space of the OP
track.

4\. 1 Resource of each of the 5 types, placed on
the matching spaces of your Storage (A).

5\. 1 Crystal, placed in the Depot (E).

6\. 1 Shelter Tech tile (set-aside earlier), placed
on the middle space of the 2nd column in
your Laboratory (B).

7\. 5 Ships, placed on the top 5 Depot spaces.

8\. 5 Shelter Buildings, 4 placed in their
positions on the right side of your Player
board, and 1 placed building-side up in one of
the Shelter starting positions according to
the number of players (as per the images to
the right and in the indicated hexes on the
main board). Shelters should be placed in a
position nearest to their respective players
for convenience.

9\. 4 Bots. 3 are placed beside your Player board,
and 1 on your Shelter on the main board.

10\. 8 Advanced Building markers, placed beside
your Player board.

11\. 12 Colonists. 3 are placed in the Living
Quarters and the remaining 9 are placed
beside the Player board.

12\. 1 Rover, placed beside your Player board.

13\. 5 Progress cubes, 1 placed below each of the
Resources.

14\. 3 Private Goal cards: Shuffle the Private Goal
cards and deal each player 3 of them face
down. Players should look at their own cards
but keep them secret from the other players.
Place the rest back in the box.

The player who has seen the film "The Martian"
the most times is the first player.


In clockwise order, starting
with the first player, each
player places their Player
marker in any empty Turn
Order space (1-8) and may
immediately receive the
benefit of that space (see
page 2 of the Reference book).

The player whose Player marker is on the
highest numbered Turn Order space places the
Shuttle on one of the Red Travel spaces (with
a number 1 in it), either on the Colony or Orbit
side (their choice).


## Minerals

Minerals are a much needed Resource on the surface of Mars. They are
used for a variety of things, and can also be used instead of any other
Resource (not Crystals). The exception to this is completing an Earth
Contract (see page 3 of the Reference book).


## IMPORTANT TERMS

. Whenever you gain something during the
game, it is taken from the general supply.
Only take it from the Warehouse on the
Main board if specifically told to do so
and the Warehouse icon is depicted.


. Resources are placed in your Storage (up to
your limit).

· Colonists are placed in your Living Quarters
(if there is an available slot). The capacity
of your Living Quarters is 4, plus 2 for each
additional Shelter you have constructed. Any
Colonists that would be placed in the Living
Quarters when there is not enough space, are
placed next to your Player board instead.

· Any Crystals gained are placed in the space
below your Depot; you cannot spend them
on the turn you gain them. At the beginning
of your next turn, move these Crystals to
your Depot. If there is not enough space,
place any excess back in the supply.

. Whenever you must pay a cost of something
(Resource or Crystal), remove it from your
Player board and place it back in the general
supply.

· A group of connected Buildings of the same
type is known as a Building Complex. The
number of Buildings within the Complex
indicates its size. A single Building not
connected to another one of the same type is
not a Complex.

· Anything that is done in Turn Order means
that you follow the order of the Player markers
on the Turn Order spaces, starting with 1 and
ending with 8.

. An empty hex is a hex on the board with
nothing in it at all.


. No hex may contain more than one piece
at the end of any player's turn. (Pieces are
Bots, Rovers, Colonists, or Advanced Building
markers.)


## GAINING CRYSTALS

Gained Crystals are initially placed below your Depot and
are only moved into your Depot at the start of your turn.


## A GREENHOUSE BUILDING COMPLEX


Note: The Generator is not a Complex as it is a standalone
Building.

## GAMEPLAY

Each round is divided into two phases:


### COLONIZATION PHASE:

In turn order, each player takes a turn during
which they perform 1 Main action and optionally 1
Executive action.


### SHUTTLE PHASE:

The Shuttle either travels between Orbit and the
Colony, or it moves closer to traveling.

Order of Play:

In the picture below, the order of play would be: Purple, Green, Yellow, and Blue.



## COLONIZATION PHASE

In this phase, all players take one turn. The order
in which players take turns is determined by the
order of the Player markers on the Turn Order
spaces, starting with the leftmost space on the
Orbit side (1) and proceeding right, ending at the
rightmost space on the Colony side (8).

On your turn, you must perform one Main action.
You may also perform one Executive action
either before or after your Main action. Executive
actions are described on page 18.

If you contribute to any of the Mission cards, you
gain 1 or 2 Crystals as depicted on the card. See
page 19 for more details of the Mission cards.

When your turn is complete, lay your Player
marker down as a reminder that you've finished
your turn. The next player then takes their turn.


### MAIN BOARD ACTIONS

There are a number of different Main actions
you can take on the Main board. If your Player
marker is on the Orbit side of the board, only
the Orbital Station actions are available to you.

Similarly, if your Player marker is on the Colony
side of the board, only the Colony actions are
available to you.

Some of the actions depict a Red Colonist icon
and/or a Teal Colonist icon, and/or a Crystal.



#### TEAL COLONIST:

This icon can be found at the bottom
of some of the action icons and
indicates that one or more Colonists
may be moved to your Working Area
to boost the power of the action. Any Colonists
in your Working Area are returned to your Living
Quarters at the end of the round if you travel.
See the individual actions for full details on this.


#### CRYSTAL:

If this icon is printed at the bottom
of the action, it means the action
can be boosted by spending
Crystals. See the individual actions for full
details on how the action is boosted.



### RED COLONIST:

This icon can be found at the top
of some action icons and indicates
that in order to perform the
action, you must place one of your
Colonists from your Living Quarters
onto one of the Action slots.

If there are currently no Colonists of other
players on the Action slots for this action,
there is no additional cost to take the action.
Otherwise, for each other player color of
Colonists already present, you must either pay
1 Crystal or move a Colonist from your Living
Quarters to your Working Area. The number of
Colonists of each color does not matter, only
the number of different colors present. If two or
more other colors of Colonists are present, you
can combine paying Crystals and/or Colonists.

2-player game: The additional cost to take the
action is 1 Crystal / Colonist for each Colonist
(both yours and your opponent's) already on
Action slots.

Actions without this icon mean that you may
take the action without placing a Colonist.
Simply declare that you are taking the action
and then resolve it.


### ORBITAL STATION MAIN ACTIONS


#### LANDING POD:

Landings using the pod are slow, painful, expensive, and lonely, but sometimes your best option. Proceed at your own risk!

This action allows you to travel to the Colony.
Follow the rules as described on page 20 for the
Shuttle Phase but skip step 1 (placing a Discovery
tile). After you have chosen a Turn Order space

on the Colony side, lay your Player marker down
to indicate that you have already taken your turn
this round. If the Shuttle travels from Mars to
Orbit this round, you may travel with it as normal.

Note: This action may seem unusual at first. The
use of this action will become clear once you
have played a few rounds.



#### OBTAIN BLUEPRINT:

Earth sends blueprints to improve the buildings and making them more effective.
More blueprints become available when the Colony grows in size and more funding
becomes available.

This action allows you to take 1 Blueprint card
from the ones available in the display. These
Blueprints are required for upgrading Buildings
(see page 16) which will provide new Executive
actions. Place the card face up next to your
Player board and gain the Resource or Crystal
depicted in the bottom right of the card.
Finally, place one of your unused Advanced
Building markers on the card. If you do not
have any Advanced Building markers remaining,
you cannot take the Blueprint. Do not draw a
replacement card.

Note: As long as the Advanced Building marker
is on the card, the depicted action cannot be
used. The marker is removed when you upgrade a
Building using the Blueprint.

Boosted action: For each Colonist you move to
your Working Area when taking this action, you
can take an additional Blueprint, following the
same rules as above.



#### LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGY:

Technology tiles allow you to perform or enhance certain actions. The more developed
they are, the more powerful they become. Tech tiles are also worth points at the end of
the game.

Take 1 Tech tile from the Tech Grid and place it
on an empty space of the leftmost column in your
Laboratory. If both of these spaces already have
a tile on them, you may not take this action.

The cost to take a tile depends on its position
in the Tech Grid. Taking a tile from one of the
bottom spaces is free, taking a tile from one of
the middle spaces costs 1 Battery, and taking
a tile from one of the top three spaces costs 1
Battery and 1 Resource of your choice. Tech tiles
are not refilled until the Colony level increases
(see page 16).

After placing the tile in your Laboratory, you
may immediately gain the benefit shown by
the graphic printed on that space. Some of
these benefits also show a Teal Colonist icon,
meaning that the action can be boosted by using
additional Colonists as normal. See the Reference
book for an explanation of these graphics.

Boosted action: You may move a Colonist to your
Working area when performing this action to take
a second Tech Tile following the same rules as
above.

Note: Each player may only have 1 Tech tile of
each type.

#### RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D):

All technological developments are carried out on the Space Station orbiting Mars.
These technologies will be put into good use on the surface of the planet.

This action allows you to develop Tech tiles on
your Player board by moving them to the right.
You may develop 1 Tech tile twice or 2 Tech tiles
once each. If you develop only 1 tile twice, treat
each of the movements separately.

To develop a Tech tile, move it to an adjacent
empty space to the right of the tile's current
position and pay the cost depicted above the
column to which the tile is moving.

If you move a Tech tile to a space with a graphic
on it, you may immediately gain the benefit of
that space (see Reference book).

Note: If a development provides you with
Resources, you can use those Resources to pay
for another development.

Note: The number above each column is the
technology level of each tile in that column. At
the end of the game, each of your Tech tiles is
worth OP depicted below the column.

Boosted action: For each Colonist you move
to your Working Area when taking this action,
develop any 1 Tech tile in your Laboratory once.
You may develop the same tile multiple times in
this way, and you may develop a tile even if you
didn't develop it with the Main action.


##### USING TECH TILES:

At various times in the game,
such as when performing an
action or gaining a benefit,
if there is a related Tech tile
(with a matching icon) owned by any player, the
effect of that action / benefit can be made more
powerful. The greater the level of the Tech tile,
the more powerful the effect.

Each time you use Tech, you may use any one
Tech tile, belonging to you or another player.

If you use another player's Tech tile, that player
takes 1 Oxygen from the general supply and
places it at the top of their Player board.

At the end of your turn, that player has the
option to immediately develop the Tech tile
that was used, at no cost (including getting the
benefit of a space they move the tile to). If they
do, the Oxygen taken earlier is placed back to
the general supply. If they cannot or
do not wish to develop the Tech tile,
they gain the Oxygen.


#### RESUPPLY:

Resources from Earth are in short supply and there is limited space in the warehouse.
More resources will arrive as the colony grows.

This action allows you to take any 1 Resource or 1
Crystal from the Warehouse and place it in your
Storage/Depot.

Boosted action: For each Colonist you move
to your Working Area when taking this action,
take 1 additional Crystal or Resource from the
Warehouse.

Reminder: You have limited capacity for storing
Crystals (the number of empty spaces in your
Depot) and Resources (equal to the number of
Shelters you have, plus one).

Note: You cannot take something from the
Warehouse if you do not have the capacity to
store it.


### COLONY MAIN ACTIONS


CONTROL CENTER:

The first robotic rover that successfully landed on Mars was Sojourner in July of
1997. Later, the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars in January 2004.
Curiosity landed in 2012 and is still operating. Rovers are responsible for most of
the information and data we have gathered from the surface of the planet.

This action allows you to move your Bots and
your Rover. You have 2 Movement points to use
for moving your Bots and 2 Movement points to
use for moving your Rover. You can do this in any
order. You could move one Bot 1 hex, then your
Rover, then another Bot (or even the same one).

Each Movement point allows you to move the
Bot / Rover to an adjacent hex.

Each Crystal you have in your Depot prior
to taking this action may be spent to gain 1
additional Movement point for either your Bots
or your Rover.

Note: Bots and Rovers can pass through, but not
end the turn on, a hex containing an Advanced
Building, Colonist, another Bot, or another Rover.


BOTS: Bots are cleaners and
builders. If a Bot ends its turn in a
hex with a Discovery or Research tile,
the tile is destroyed and removed
from the game. If a Bot ends the turn
in a hex with a Crystal, return the
Crystal back to the general supply.

The hex the Bot is in
and all adjacent hexes
are classed as that
Bot's Building Zone.
This is relevant for
constructing and
upgrading Buildings
(pages 13 and 16).



ROVER: Rovers travel around
the map collecting Crystals by
simply passing over them, or
Discovery tiles and Research tiles
if they end the turn on them.

At the start of the game, although the piece
representing your Rover is next to your Player
board, your Rover is actually at the starting Mine
in the center of the board. When you move your
Rover for the first time in the game, first place
your Rover on the starting Mine and then count
hexes from there.

You can also use a Rover Tech tile to gain
additional Movement points equal to the level of
the Tech tile.

You may collect any Crystals on hexes you pass
through or land on. Take them from the board
and place them in the space below your Depot as
if you had gained them (you cannot spend them
this turn).

After you have performed all your movement, if
there is a Discovery or Research tile on the hex
where your Rover is, you may remove that tile
from the board to gain the benefit as long as you
meet the following conditions:

. You must not have already taken a Research
tile of that color and letter.

. You must pay any cost associated with the
benefit.

. You must be able to take at least some of the
benefit. If you cannot, your Rover cannot end
its movement on that hex.

If you gain a tile, resolve it immediately by
paying any associated cost, then place it in
your play area (put Discovery tiles face down).
Discovery and Research tiles may be needed to
complete a Mission or a Private Goal.

See the Reference book for a detailed list of the
Discovery and Research tiles.


#### USING ROVER TECHNOLOGY


When moving your Rover, you can
increase its range by using the
related Tech tile (see page 11 for
the full rules on using Tech tiles).

Example:



If you use a level-3 Rover Tech tile, you add
3 more Movement points for a total of 5.



A Rover moves 5 hexes, collecting a
Crystal on the way and then claiming the
Discovery tile.
